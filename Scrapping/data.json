The objective is to go out of this room by solving enigmas and succeding as a team in small tasks. May Sherlock wits be with us! 🧐\n\n==⚠️ 🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️⚠️ ==\n🦅: we speak English/French in all our events and normally your level doesn't matter. However, for this specific event language is important as you should be able to read and understand French to advance and understand the game 😉.\n🐓 : Nous parlons français et anglais dans tous nos évènements et en général le niveau n'a pas trop d'importance. Cependant, pour ce cas spécifique, votre niveau est important car vous devez être en mesure de lire et comprendre le Français pour avancer et comprendre le jeu 😉.\n\n== 🧐 What's the plan, Watson? 🧐==\nThe 1st step is to gather a group of 5 people. I suggest we go to this escape room: https://www.challengetheroom.fr/challenge-the-room-grenoble-notre-dame.html. When we are enough, we will all decide which enigma we do as there are several options ☺️. I will do the booking. Tomorrow we meet next to the fountaine place Grenette and we will all go together at the escape room.\n\n== 💡 Rules 💡 ==\n- Don't be late, we have to respect the timing of the company 😇\n- Since places are limited, please do not subscribe if you are not sure to join the event ☺️\n\n== ❔ What do you need for an escape game ❔ ==\n- Not much actually, come as you are... Or if you are crazy enough (and I like that) bring a costume respecting the theme of the escape game 🤣\n- Cost will be between 30 and 22€ depending on our number, so bring some money 💲\n- Your smile 😁 / Happiness 😊\n- Your mask as always 😷 (avoid contact and so on)\n- Your brain (we will need it) 🧠\n\n== After the event ==\nIf you feel like it, we can share a drink, a pizza or an ice cream depending on the mood of the crowd.\n\n== 😷 Covid rules 😷 ==\n- Don't come if you feel sick, have fever, are contact case,...\n- As always, wear your mask (we will not wear the mask during the activity 😉)\n- You are responsible of your own health, so respect barrier gestures, social distancing, ...\n- All rules: https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19\n\n--------------------------------\nIf you don't speak French, reach me as we can launch a 2nd group for english speaker as https://www.live-escape.net/book/ as some english speaking escape room and YOU will be the organizer! 😉 And we can all meet after our respective game!\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know!\nSi vous avez des questions, faites moi signe!\n\nA demain!\nJulien for the GAC.",

Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas \"suffisant\".\n\n== 🔦Speleology in Vercors: Grotte des Eymards (Eymards Cave) 🧗 ==\nAre you ready some new adventure? I just booked a initiation to speleology made by a professionnal guide. I never done this type of activity, so I post this event here in case you want to participate and discover the joy of underground climbing. 😉 I have a car so I can carpool 3 more people at the start which is in Lans en Vercors. On the website, there are still 9 people who can join (the guide can manage only a limited number of people). If you have a car let me know in the comment section (I will increase the number of participant up to 12)!\n\n== ❔ How to participate and register? ❔ ==\n🛎️ ⚠️: Group is full!\n\n== 🧗‍♂️ Details about the activity 🧗‍♂️ ==\nSpeleology is climbing inside a cave. So it's underground 😅 (if you are claustrophobic, this is probably not for you). There will be some climbing, ramping and a 30m abseiling (rappel)... But be reassured, a professionnal guide will be there to assist you at any time if you haven't done it before (it's my case). So it will be only fun!! 😍\n\n=== 🚗 share ===\nCar share will cost 3€ per person (fuel + \"compensation\" to get more drivers). We will park our car(s) at the parking of the cave.\n\n== ❔🧗‍♂️ What do you need for speleology ❔🧗‍♂️ ==\n✔️ A specific suit, a light and helmet will be given by the guide\n- Sporty and warm clothes (it's between 10-15°C undeground so make sure to bring at least a \"polaire\")\n- Sport shoes\n- Water and small things to eat (energy bar type): 🍫 + 🧃\n\n== After the event ==\nIf you feel like it, we can share a drink, a pizza or an ice cream depending on the mood of the crowd.\n\n== 😷 Covid rules 😷 ==\n- Don't come if you feel sick, have fever, are contact case,...\n- As always, wear your mask (we will not wear the mask during the activity 😉)\n- You are responsible of your own health, so respect barrier gestures, social distancing, ...\n- All rules: https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19\n\n-----------------------\nIf you have any questions or problem to book, please let me know!\nSi vous avez des questions ou des problèmes pour réserver, faites moi signe!\n\nA dimanche,\nJulien from GAC.",

This is where the game will begin.\n\nFor those of you who joined in yesterdays game, it is similair but instead of focusing on Street Art, this game will focus on all the handicap advancements the city of Grenoble has made. And I can already tell you that we will need to translate braille again like yesterday :)\n\nFor those of you who did not join us yesterday, the game will be a suprise for you ;)\n\nSo bring a charged smart phone if you have one, and if not do not worry we always work in teams!\n\nSo don't be shy! Come for the fun, the game, to meet people, and to discuss this weekends hike!\n\nÀ mercredi !\n\n- The Grenoble Hiking Club",

And there is a lot of information!\n\nIt will last between 4 and 9 hours depending on your comfortability (+ after hike pizza, beer, ice cream). Let me explain.\n\nThere are 2 required steps, and 3 optional choices.\n\nYou can find them below. We do it like this because many people have different objectives when hiking, skill levels, and time schedules. With a plan like this we hope that everyone can participate!\n\n!!Required Step # 1\nBe to Col de Porte at 9am.\n\nFor many of us we will plan to be at Place Notre Dame – Musée bus stop at 7:50am for the 8:10 bus. This will get us to Col de Porte at 8:45am. If you choose to drive you are welcome to do that.\n\n!!Required Step # 2\nHike to Chamchaud\n\nThis is a 3.6KM hike with a 786 meter incline (Dénivelé) this should take 2-2.5 hours. Here we will eat lunch and enjoy the view (2,082 meters!)\n\n--------------------------------------\n*Optional Choice # 1\nDescend and return to Col de Porte for bus back to Grenoble\n\nThis should take 1-1.5 hours. This is a 786 meter decline (dénivelé négatif) and is 3.6KM (same path we took to arrive at the summit).\n\nBuses from Col de Porte to Grenoble on Saturday are at 15h45/17h10/18h30.\n\n**Optional Choice # 2\nContinue on to le Sappy en Chartreuse.\n\nThis should take 2 – 2.5 hours. This is a 1066 meter decline (dénivelé négatif) from Chamchaud and is 7.5KM. From here you can choose to take the bus back to Grenoble if you would like.\n\nBuses from le Sappy en Chartreuse to Grenoble on Saturday are at 15h54/17h19/18h39.\n\n***Optional Choice # 3\nContinue on to Col de Vence while visiting Fort du St-Eynard\n\nThis should take 1 – 1.5 hours. This is a 365 meter incline (Dénivelé) from le Sappy en Chartreuse and is 4.5KM. From here you can take the bus back to Grenoble.\n\nBuses from Col de Vence to Grenoble on Saturday are 15h59/17h24/18h44.\n\nSo, if you plan to take option # 3, this option could take 6.5 hours (+ lunch and breaks = 8-9 hours). If it takes us the full 9 hours (from 9am) we will have 44 minutes (+/-) in Col de Vence waiting for the 18h44 bus.\n\nI and at least 2 other people have commited to option # 3\n\nWe will take all necessary adjustments with time and ensure that anyone who wants to stop at options #1 or #2 or go on to option #3 will not be stranded and will be placed at the bus stop without worry. This is not a race, don't worry about that! The most important thing is that you come! We want to meet you so don't be shy!\n\nThis is a big schedule!\n\nThe point is not to see how fast we can go, but how much we can appreciate the views :)\n\nFor those returning to Grenoble city center after option # 3 and for those who are interested, we will continue on for a beer, pizza, or ice cream. Or maybe all three!\n\nThings to remember:\nWhat you will absolutely need to bring:\nA backpack for food and water\nA comfortable pair of shoes\n2 or 3 liters of water\nSnacks (chips, sausage, fruit etc...)\nLunch (sandwich)\n\nWhat you may want to bring but is not needed:\nBâtons de randonnée\nA well charged camera/phone if you would like to take pictures\nSun screen\nBug spray\n\nThis will be an experience and challenge for all of us. No time estimates are 100% accurate as we will need to adjust to the needs of others. But one thing that is certain is we will all have fun and stay safe together!\n\nIf there are any questions or if someone would like to add additional information please do not hesitate!\n\nIf you prefer clarification in the French language you can post your comment in French and we will try to respond as soon as possible with a native speaker.\n\n- The Grenoble Hiking Club",

I propose to you the following for tomorrow.\n\nWhat: Hike Circuit Mont Jalla – Mont Rachais\n\nWhere: We will meet at the Fontaine du Lion et du Serpent (105 Rue Saint-Laurent) we can start with a coffee and croissant + introduction before starting to ascend (We will begin this hike from the Bastille directly)\n\nWhen: Sunday June 28 @ 9am – 5pm (?) I will be at the café that adjoins the fountain at 9am with my coffee waiting for others (wearing a blue shirt and I have blond hair - send me a message if you do not see me).\n\nWe will then plan to leave the cafe and begin the hike around 9:30am. Normally this route including the Bastille (ascend & descend) is planned @ 5.5 hours but I prefer to take several breaks along the way to make the hike as comfortable as possible for everyone and to enjoy the scenery. We should also plan a good amount of time to stop and have snack breaks plus a longer lunch break.\n\nI also suggest returning to our point of the departure after the hike to have a soft drink or beer for those who would like (and discuss planning the next hike together!)\n\nDescription: Circuit Mont Jalla - Mont Rachais is a 9.7 km moderately used loop trail located near Grenoble, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes in France. The trail will introduce you to wild flowers and is rated as difficult. The trail offers many activities and is best used from March to November. Dogs are welcome on this trail.\n\nDistance:\n9.7 km\n\nDénivelé:\n507 m (starting from top of Bastille)\n\nWhat you will absolutely need to bring:\nA backpack for food and water\nA comfortable pair of shoes\n2 or 3 liters of water\nSnacks (chips, sausage etc...)\nLunch (sandwich)\n\nWhat you may want to bring but is not needed:\nBâtons de randonnée\nA well charged camera/phone if you would like to take pictures\nSun screen\nBug spray\n\nIf there are any questions or if someone would like to add additional information please do not hesitate!\n\nHope to see you tomorrow!",

Then you will help me to coach the noobs.\n\n== ⭐⭐ Updates ⭐⭐ ==\n- 📅 Feb 11 - 4pm: more cars = more seats.

We will stay together during the whole day.\n\n✅ If you are a good skier, you can join but you will stay with the group and help NOOBs to learn how to ski. This event is not about having a ride to a ski station and ski alone. You will stay in the group and help noobs.\n\n🟨 DO NOT BRING YOUR SKI (unless you have your own car) cause there is not enough place in my car. We will rent ski directly at the station.\n\nMeet at 8:15am at parking \"Esplanade du Souvenir Français\" near Parc Paul Mistral:\n- https://www.osm.org/way/69486256\n- https://goo.gl/maps/BAbHQ153PcNgunPd6\n\nWe ride our cars for about 45m.

It will take time if we are a big group so be patient. The shop is open 9am-12:30pm and 1pm-5pm. So we will stop ski near 4:30pm to bring the ski to the shop.\n\nRenting Ski + Ski shoes + pole + helmet = 20€50 (Detail here: https://s.42l.fr/-7o3JT-y)\n\n== 💲 Ski Pass 💲 ==\nTo enter the ski station, you need a ski pass. Two options:\n- 13€80 Only the beginner part of the station (we will take this option)\n- 21€ Full station\n\nMap & price: https://www.lansenvercors.com/domaine-alpin-des-montagnes-de-lans.html\n\nThis is not my idea... but if you are happy with your \"ski teacher\" you can help him/her pay his/her ski pass 😇💙\n\n=== 🚗 share ===\nCar share will cost 5€ per person (fuel + \"compensation\" to get more drivers). 😷 You have to wear a mask in car.\n\n=== For drivers 🚗 ===\nDrivers needs (mandatory):\n- ⛄Either 4 winter or 4 four seasons tires\n- 🔗Either 2 car snow chains (~25€ at Carrefour)\n- 🧦Either 2 car snow socks\n\nhttps://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/actualites/A14389?lang=en\n\n== 💡 Rules 💡 ==\n- 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️ The GAC group is about hiking 🥾 and why not making friends BUT NOT about flirting or speed dating ⛔\n- Don't throw any dump 🚮 in nature even egg shell 🥚, fruit pelt 🍌, ... 🌳 ❤️ You\n- Subscribe on the waiting list.

In two (2) parts:\n\nWe will meet at the rally point and walk to the village of Sassenage.\n\n1. We will visit the underground Caves/Cuves du Sassenage for a guided tour. The cost is [Adult: 8 € ; Student : 7 € ; Enfant : 5 €] and it takes about 30 minutes.\n\nNOTE: The temperature underground is 10 - 15degC, so one must bring a jacket or hoodie, even if it is 35degC on the surface.\n\n2. After the tour is over, we will take a walk and follow the beautiful trail that shadows \"Le Furon\", named for it's stunning beauty and potential ferocity, a series of cascades that descend from the heart of the Vercor Mountains down into the village of Sassenage (just north-west of Grenoble).\n\nNear the cascades, temperatures are normally 5degC cooler than in the city center, so this is an exceptionally good place/location to visit during the \"dog days of summer\" in Grenoble to beat the heat.\n\n== Walking Route Details ==\n\nThe walk/hike part of the event event is 5 miles / 8km distance over mixed terrain (Roads, Trails, Cascades/Boulders) - Out and Back\n\nRoute Details at: https://www.alltrails.com/explore/map/thu-07-jan-2021-21-25-0906061\n\nDuration: 3 hours max\n\nRally Point on Google Maps: https://goo.gl/maps/n9V3aFhov3GWrQ5F9\n(Bus Shelter on North West side of station)\n\nIf you're new to Grenoble, just board the Tram-A anywhere headed West (towards La Poya) and get off at the last stop!\n\n== Detailed Plan ==\n\nExpected Schedule:\n\n* 12:59-13:15: Rally between at Tram-A line stop \"La Poya\"\n* 13:15h: Walk to Village/Caves de Sassenage (20-30 mins)\n* 13:40: Arrive in Village Sassenage / Caves\n* 14:00-14:30h: Arrive and start Guided Tour of Caves (\\*)\n* 14:30-15:30h: Hike along Furon (Stops along the way to enjoy the cool temps)\n* 15:30 \\~ 16:30: Walk Back to Tram-A/La Poya Station\n* 16:30h: (End of Event) Arrive/Return Back to Tram Line-A at stop \"La Poya\"\n* (\\*) If there is a delay arriving at 14h, we can take the tour at 14:30h as-well.\n\nNOTE: The event is officially over after we board the return A tram!\n\nHowever, if anyone wats to take a coffee or bubble tea after the event, I wont object proposal!\n\n== 🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️ ==\n\n🦅/🐓 : We speak English/French in all our events. Don't worry if your English/French is not that good. Nos évènements sont en Anglais et Français.

    "description": "Update on 30/07/20:\nDate is confirmed on the saturday! It will be hot so bring water, hat etc... Rain jacket is advised as we might encounter some rain after 5pm (it should worry mostly people doing Itinerary 1 ;) ). For people who registered but didn't say which itinerary they were doing, please indicate it in the comment section. We have 1 or 2 people that are happy to drive to Itinerary 2, so if you are looking for a lift contact them directly through the App to set the details between you. ;) Additional things to bring: some cash + face mask for the bus and carpooling.\n\nOriginal message\n---////////---\nHi everyone, Salut à tous,\nAfter the \"passerelles de Monteynard\", the Mont Jala and Rachais and Chamechaude, let's continue the Grenoble classics with : \"La dent de Crolles\" (the Crolles teeth)! :)\n\n/!\\ The date (saturday or sunday) is not definitive yet because I wait for the weather forecast to be a bit more precise to fix it. But for now, let's assume this will take place on saturday. It will be fixed by Thursday evening.\n\nAgain, I am trying to do a 2 level hikes to adapt to the different levels.\n\n***********\nItinerary 1 - The most difficult and tiring ;)\nMeet 7h50 at the bus stop \"Notre-Dame Musée\" to take the bus 62 at 8h08. Stop at le Sappey en Chartreuse for the 1st part of the hike up to Col du Coq. We should arrive around 12h30 and join the other part of the group (look for itinerary 2). Then we climb la dent de Croles and come back to col du coq (additional details in itinerary 2). The itinerary 2 stops there. We continue to go down until the location \"Les Meunières\" where we should be able to take the 6550 bus at 17h25 to come back to Grenoble. Timing is a bit tight but it should be doable.\nSlope (Denivelé) : + and - 1300m\nLength: 18km\nDuration: 9h\nLink: https://www.visorando.com/randonnee-/3694674\n\n***********\nItinerary 2 (car or carpooling needed):\nJoin the 1st part of the group at 12h30 at Col du Coq. It's 50min drive from grenoble (meeting point and time to be agreed between carpoolers). The all group does together the climb of Dent de Crolles. I plan we eat around le col de Ayes after 1h of hiking, but this we can adapt of course. This part is rated as a moderate with some easy climbing steps. The view at the top is quite nice. We go in a loop so the return is not the same but we come back to the departure point where you can go back to grenoble by car.\nSlope (Denivelé): + and - 650 m (Chamechaude level for those who did this hike)\nLength: 6.5km\nDuration: 4h30\nLink: https://www.altituderando.com/Dent-de-Crolles-2062m-par-le-Trou-du-Glaz\n\n************\nWhen back in Grenoble we can have food and drinks to regain some of the calories we lost during the hike ;)\n\nI personnaly will do itinerary 1, but I am quite sure some people with cars will be willing to do the 2nd itinerary so don't hesitate to mention it in the comment section. ;) Please indicate in the comment section what you plan to do (and if you have a car for Itinerary 2) so we can anticipate. If you wish to carpool with someone please respond to the comment posted by the driver so we keep track on the number of people in the cars. :)\n\nWhat you will absolutely need to bring:\n- A backpack for food and water\n- A comfortable pair of sport shoes (hiking shoes preferably if you do Itinerary 1)\n- 2 or 3 liters of water (it will be hot so make sure to bring enough :) )\n- Snacks (chips, sausage, fruit etc...)\n- Lunch (sandwich)\n- Sun screen + hat as it will be certainly very hot and sunny.\n\nWhat you may want to bring but is not needed:\n- Hiking poles/Bâtons de randonnée\n- A well charged camera/phone for pictures\n- Bug spray\n\nThis will be an experience and challenge for all of us. No time estimates are 100% accurate as we will need to adjust to the needs of others. But one thing that is certain is we will all have fun and stay safe together!\n\nDon't hesitate if you have question (in french or english).\nN'hésitez pas si vous avez des questions.\n--\nJulien for the GAC",

    "description": "-- Update July 22 2020 --\n\nOk, we have put together the final planning.\n\nWe will do a 6 hour tour du Lac de Paladru with some swimming at Plage de Palandru.\n\nThe hike will begin (and end) at l'Office de Tourisme de Charavines (but remember we will all meet at Gare de Grenoble at 9am for car sharing).\n\nOr for others who are interested in meeting us directly at the tourism office we will see you there (around 10am). There is a lot of free parking next to the tourist office.\n\nAbout halfway through the hike (+/-) we will arrive at Plage de Paladru. Here we will take our time to eat lunch (pack a lunch or buy something at the beach) and do some swimming until we are ready to finish the hike.\n\nEntrance to the beach is 3 euro per person. So passengers of vehicles will need 10 euro for the transportation + 3 euro for the beach.\n\nReservations to the beach will be made for everyone before Sunday.\n\nA description of the hike can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.paysvoironnais.info/itineraire/le-tour-du-lac-de-paladru-1-1.html\n\nA description of the beach can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.paysvoironnais.info/villages-du-lac-de-paladru/plage-municipale-de-paladru/autres-loisirs.html\n\nAs always, be sure to bring a sufficient amount of water and comfortable shoes (and proper swimsuit if you plan to get in the water). No birthday suits here!\n\nAnd bring a mask if you wish to buy something at the beach (food or drink).\n\nDon’t hesitate if you have any questions or comments.\n\nA dimanche !\n\n**********************************************\n--Initial Posting July 20 2020--\n\nOk, so there are going to be a lot more details to come so be sure to stay updated by visiting (and reading!) the details of this event :)\n\nWe will plan a hiking and swimming extravaganza at and around Le lac de Paladru this Sunday.\n\nIt will require some coordination as we will plan to take cars. So far we have three cars with some available seats. We are interested to know if there are any other available cars/drivers for this event.\n\nComme d'hab we will meet at la Gare de Grenoble for the meeting place when we take cars. Drivers will also be reimbursed 10 euro per each passenger (to take the train is 15 euro for a passenger + a lot of walking so we all win when we take cars).\n\nSo at this moment we are only trying to organize how many cars/places are available for the event. Once we know this we will create further details. Donc, if you are willing to drive and have available seats please contact me, or make a comment in the event as soon as possible!\n\nYou are also free to drive directly to the lake without joining us at the train station and we will meet you there. It's up to you.\n\nWe will open the event with 8 places with the current car situation and add more as potential drivers may join as well. We will also define the details of the hike and swimming in the next day or two, but plan on a full day of hiking and swimming (environ huit heures).\n\n- TEAM GAC (Grenoble Adventure Club)",

Tous nos évènements sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas bon.\n\nRent your equipment!\n=================\nYou need to rent your Via Ferrata equipment (casque+baudrier+longes).\n\nFor example, you can go to the shop \"Adrénaline Sport\" near the cinema \"Pathé Chavant\" (https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4367709826). You should try the equipment into the shop to see if it sweet you well.\n\nYou will be charge only for one day rent (10 or 15€), to do so you need to rent on Saturday between 18:00 & 19:00 (shop is closed on Sunday), then we will give back the equipment Sunday to \"Domino's Pizza\" at the corner (https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1324802814)\n\nThis event is free except the renting of Via Ferrata equipment.\n\nWhat do you need\n=================\n- Via Ferrata equipment : casque+baudrier+longes\n- A good pair of shoes (hiking shoes are highly recommended otherwise you will slip on the rocks)\n- Some water\n- Some snack and some food if you want to lunch together\n\nInitiation to Via Ferrata\n=====================\nI (Albin) am not a guide and i will not be responsible of you or your security. But I will teach you how to do Via Ferrata safely. I'm also used to do Via Ferrata with totally beginners, so I will ensure that you can complete the Via Ferrate safely.\n\nBTW, there are 2 possibilities to \"exit\" the Via Ferrata if you are really tired.\n\nFor safety reason, I will limit the group to a maximum of 7 people including me.\n\nAbout \"Les prises de la Bastille\"\n==============================\nThis Via Ferrata have 2 parts:\n- First part is really easy but very vertiginous and have no exit.\n- Second part is hard but not vertiginous and have 2 exits.\n\nMore info\n=========\nDetails about this Via Ferrata: https://www.viaferrata-fr.net/via-ferrata-1-Les-Prises-de-la-Bastille-Grenoble-Is%E8re.html\nDuration : ~2h\nStart & end point : https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3761669727 (don't climb up to the Bastille, the start point is on left when facing the entrance of \"Jardin des Dauphins\")",

    "description": "--FR/EN--\n\nLet's do Geocaching for noobs!\n==============================\nThis session, we will seek some \"mystery caches\"... but for noobs. Before finding caches, we will need to solve some challenges/puzzle to get each cache coordinates : counting trees, summing elements on visuals and so on. I will bring some paper and pencils in order to solve each puzzle. If interested, you can download the app \"c:geo\" (Android only) to be able the solve those challenges.\n\nAbout the group/A propos du groupe\n====================================\nEN: Everybody is welcome to join the group, we can speak in French, English, etc.\nFR: Tout le monde est bienvenu, nous pourrons disctuer en français, anglais, etc.\n\nAbout the trails\n===============\nWe will start at Parc Paul Mistral near the \"Vasque Olympique\" at 15:30.\nAnd we will end at the campus. Depending on time and our mood we can do other caches and go back to Grenoble center by walking, then grab a beer and some food.\n\nAbout geocaching\n==================\nGeocaching is a worldwide game, your goal is to find \"cache\" basically a box with a logbook inside and some other funny stuffs. When found, you will have to write our Geocaching username on it to be credited by game points.\n\nMore details\n============\nMap with the 17 planned caches: http://u.osmfr.org/m/481099/\nMap with the \"hiking profile\": https://frama.link/-BXwJVSk\nDownload c:geo Android app: https://www.cgeo.org/\nYou can create a geocaching account for free: https://www.geocaching.com",

    "description": "***Update:\n\nThere should open seats for this event (we hope!) so please join the waiting list and we will see!\n\nPlease read everything below and be sure to understand all before registering for the wait so there is no confusion! :)\n\n**********************************\nHey Gang!\n\nWe would like to plan something a little festive and relaxing to celebrate the French Revolution on Tuesday July 14th!\n\nAs our group is composed of outdoor enthusiast we would like to plan a hike and beach day :)\n\nThe hike will be of low difficulty level (as we will still be sore from Sunday!) so any and all skill levels can complete this, even babies!\n\nThe hike will include \"Les passerelles himalayennes\" - Leila mentioned these previously in conversation, so technically it's her idea :)\n\nThe views are wonderful and we will pass many beautiful sites and flowers - Siwar bring your plant identification application!\n\nYou can find more information about the July 14th “Freedom Hike” here:\n\nhttp://www.lac-monteynard.com/fr/26-Passerelles_vers_l-aventure\n\nIf you have done this before and have info to share with the group don't hesitate in the comments section.\n\nWhile a train option from Grenoble is possible it will include a little bit of additional walking from the train station at Monestier-de-Clermont to arrive to our destination - which is no problem for the Grenoble Hiking Club!\n\nBut we are also seeking out volunteer drivers who may also be interested in ride sharing. The drive is about 1 hour from Grenoble city center or 58KM.\n\nAs an incentive to drivers and to cover all fuel cost’s we will set the round trip (aller retour) cost per passenger at 10 euro (14,20 euro for the train - so passengers save and drivers gain).\n\nSo if you are a driver and have three available seats that’s 30 euro to you, if you have four available seats that’s 40 euro, etc…\n\nThis event will cost everyone 6 euro for a required boat ride as part of the circuit, cost of food (pack what you want or eat at a café), and the cost of being a passenger in a vehicle (or profit if you are a driver!)\n\nThe hike + boat ride will take 4.5 hours, plus lets plan on spending a few more hours (another 4.5 hours) either doing additional hiking, swimming, socializing or eating and enjoying the views - I will be doing a little bit of everything, mais tu fais ce que tu veux :)\n\nIdeally we should plan to leave Grenoble around 8:30am and depart back to Grenoble around 5:30pm - once back in Grenoble we can plan something else to wrap the evening up.\n\nWe will provide more details soon, but it will be a good time guaranteed so don't worry about that! Just save the date!\n\nPlease do not RSVP to this event yet!\n\nWe need to first plan the logistics and then we will send out an updated planning schedule tomorrow night - before we get too tired from Julien's hike on Sunday ;) - so be ready to RSVP Tomorrow !!\n\nThe objective for the moment is to know how to organize the transportation between train and car, so if you are an available driver and this event sounds interesting to you, send me a message! Like that we can plan better :)\n\nHopefully we will have enough drivers so we can stay together and not be seperated by train and car :)\n\nSo if you are interested in this event and ride sharing please send a message to me via Meetup or SMS @ 07 87 86 12 95 as soon as possible with the number of available seats. N'oublie pas 10 euro per available seat!\n\nAdditionally, if someone has some information or ideas for fireworks in the evening please feel free to share. The only thing I can find is an hour from Grenoble city center and also an hour from where we will be at for the hiking and swiming. So if you know of something that is convenient please let us know!\n\n** and in the spirit of democracy, freedom, and liberty, be prepared to vote on a new name for the club on Tuesday!!\n\nVIVE LA FRANCE, VIVE LA LIBERTÉ, VIVE LA RÉPUBLIQUE !!!",

    "description": "As the 1st edition worked quite well, we try again an \"À la carte\" hike where you are free to choose how much you want to do! It can last between 4 and 9 hours depending on your comfortability. Let me introduce you the plan:\n\nThere are 2 required steps, and 3 optional choices.\n\nYou can find them below. We do it like this because many people have different objectives when hiking, skill levels, and time schedules. With a plan like this everyone can participate!\n\n!!Required Step # 1\nBe to Chamrousse at 9am. For many of us we plan to take the bus 707 in direction of Chamrousse. Let's meet at Place de Verdun at 7:20am, the bus leaves at 7:40am (I know it's early but the hike worth it ;) ). This will get us to the station at 8:55am. If you choose to drive you are welcome to do that.\n\n!!Required Step # 2\nWe will all hike together to Lacs Robert after Lac Achard. This is a 4.5KM hike with a 530 meter incline (Dénivelé) this should take 2-2.5h. Here we plan to eat lunch and enjoy the view (2100 meters!). And if you dare you may want to have a swim in the Lac Robert (I can't garanty the water in warm though ;) ).\n\n--------------------------------------\n*Optional Choice # 1\nDescend and return to Chamrousse for bus back to Grenoble.\n\nThis should take around 2 hours. This is a 530 meter decline (dénivelé négatif) and is 4.5KM (a loop around la croix de Chamrousse).\n\nBuses from Chamrousse to Grenoble on Sunday are at 14h15/17h20 (for line 707) and 13h45/18h35 for line 6010.\n\n**Optional Choice # 2\nContinue to see cascade de l'Oursière and end the hike in St Martin d'Uriage.\n\nThis should take 3 hours. This is a 1200 meter decline (dénivelé négatif) from Lac Robert and is 8KM. From here you can take the bus back to Grenoble if you like.\n\nBuses from St Martin d'Uriage - les Seiglières to Grenoble on Sunday are 707: 14h50/17h50 or 6010: 14h10/19h00.\n\n***Optional Choice # 3\nIf you want to enjoy as much as possible (and be as tired as possible), option 3 is for you ;) It goes around 1 more lake up to Refuge de la Pra and the Cascade de l'Oursière to end up in St Martin d'Uriage.\n\nThis should take 6 hours. This is adds 300 meter incline (Dénivelé) and 1500m meter decline from lacs Robert and is 13KM. From here you can take the bus back to Grenoble.\n\nBuses from St Martin d'Uriage - les Seiglières to Grenoble on Sunday are 707: 17h50 or 6010: 19h00.\n\nSo, for option # 3, it could take 8 hours (+ breaks = 8-8.5 hours). Depending on how fast we go, we might be able to catch the 17h50 bus with a 20 minutes window. If we can't make it, we can still take the 6010 bus but you should prepare some change as the tickets are sold only on the bus for 4.6€.\n\nWe did not plan this as a race, so you will be able to catch a bus. We will do at least the 1st part of the hike together up to Lacs Robert! So the most important thing is that you come! We want to meet you, don't be shy!\n\nFor those returning to Grenoble city center after option # 3 and for those who are interested, we will continue on for a beer, pizza, or ice cream. Or maybe all three!\n\n###################\nWhat you will absolutely need to bring:\nA backpack for food and water\nA comfortable pair of sport shoes (preferably hiking shoes if you are going to option 2 or 3).\n2 or 3 liters of water (no water point on the tracks, so bring enough)\nSnacks (chips, sausage, fruit...)\nLunch (sandwich)\nHat/Cap\n\nWhat you may want to bring but is not needed:\nBâtons de randonnée (strongly recommended if you aim for option 2/3 because there is a lot of decline)\nA well charged camera/phone if you would like to take pictures\nSun screen, Sun glasses\nBug spray\nSwim suit and towel if you plan to swim\nChange for the bus 6010\n\nThis will be an experience and challenge for all of us. No time estimates are 100% accurate as we will need to adjust to the needs of others. But one thing that is certain is we will all have fun and stay safe together!\n\nDon't hesitate if you have question (in french or english).\n\nThe Grenoble Hiking Club",

    "description": "Our official weekend hike is sure to be on Sunday (details coming very soon), so let’s plan on something Saturday afternoon/evening.\n\nWe are sure to do a lot of things in addition to hiking so a name change for the group may be happening soon, so don't be suprised by this.\n\nThis will be a follow-up event on Saturday after Brian’s Musée Stendhal event. If you have not already joined his event be sure to do so here:\n\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Social-Meetup-English-French-redux/events/vfxsmrybcfbdc/\n\nAfter Musée Stendhal we will start our 2nd “city hike” with Geocaching (thanks to Julien M for all his good ideas!)\n\nWhat is Geocaching?\n\nGeocaching is a real-world, outdoor adventure that is happening all the time, all around the world. To play, participants use the Geocaching app and/or a GPS device to navigate to cleverly hidden containers called geocaches. There are millions of geocaches in 190 countries waiting to be discovered—there are probably even some near you right now.\n\nMore info here: https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2018/03/what-is-geocaching/\n\nI have never done this type of activity before so it will be something new for me! I added an app though to my phone and there are a lot of caches in Grenoble and in the city center. There are even a lot in the mountains too which could make for some interesting hikes in the future!\n\nThe organization I imagine will need to be developed based on the number of people participating, so let’s wait and see. But as always, the more people the better so be sure to join!\n\nThe basic planning so far is to meet at 3:30pm after Musée Stendhal, do a few hours of Geocaching, then finish with getting something to eat or drink.\n\nThis will also serve as another opportunity to get in-person details about Sundays hike if you have any questions.\n\nWe cannot be out too late though as Sunday’s hike is sure to start early :)\n\nSee you soon!",

We will not do the long loop in case of fog and rain also since the trail can be slippery and dangerous.

Perhaps at a future Hybrid/Crossover event between the GAC / Museum Circuit).\n\nBONUS: Local HISTORY ( MUSEUM Meetup ): As a special treat for those of you who also attend my Museum events, and who have come to the Museum of the Resistance and Deportation, we'll make an extra special trip to visit a memorial dedicated to the Maquis resistance of the Vercors.\n\nIf you're new to the Grenoble Adventure Club, and you've already hiked up the Bastille, and you're considering hiking more-challenging events with the GAC, this is an excellent opportunity to test your fitness, familiarize / sample the local geography, and test your gear (Break in your new boots)\n\n== Route Details ==\n\nThis event is 5 miles / 8km distance over mixed terrain (Roads, Trails, Cascades/Boulders) - Out and Back\n\nWe will have a 1500 feet / 500m elevation gain (Compatible to Bastile w/ Mount Jala)\n\nRoute Details at: https://www.alltrails.com/explore/map/thu-07-jan-2021-21-25-0906061\n\nDuration: 3 hours max\n\nRally Point on Google Maps: https://goo.gl/maps/n9V3aFhov3GWrQ5F9\n\nIf you're new to Grenoble, just board the Tram-A anywhere headed West (towards La Poya) and get off at the last stop!\n\n== Detailed Plan ==\n\nExpected schedule:\n\n* 13:30-14:00h Rally between at Tram-A line stop \"La Poya\"\n* 14:00h: Walk to Village/Caves de Sassenage (15-20minuetes)\n* 14:30h: Begin of Hike (Stops along the way to enjoy the cool temps)\n* 15:30h: Arrive at WWII Maquis Memorial (Rest)\n* 15:45h: Hike Back to Tram-A/La Poya\n* 16:30h: Arrive/Return Back to Tram Line-A at stop La Poya\n\nNOTE: The event is officially over after we board the return tram!\n\nHowever, if anyone wats to take a coffee or bubble tea after the event, I wont object to your [indecent] proposal!\n\n== 🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️ ==\n\n🦅/🐓 : We speak English/French in all our events.

    "description": "Ask yourself: How does a bougie chateau in the south of France act as a symbol for the French Revolution, which resulted in removing [the heads of] the aristocracy?\n\nCome find out for yourself! We will return to Vizille! Pack a lunch picnic and pump of your Vélo tyres! On-y-va!\n\nVizille is an exhibit, free to all, and is run by the Govt.. It is composed of the outdoor garden spaces (which includes an outdoor zoo of sorts), as well as the Museum housed within a Chateau/Castle.\n\nThe chateau played a pivotal role in the history of the aftermath of the French revolution; this pivotal time in French history is the subject of the museum; come and learn about it!\n\nDetails about the Museum (en Anglais!):\nhttps://www.grenoble-tourisme.com/en/discover/essentials/domaine-de-vizille/\n\n=== Main Route ===\n\nThe Vélo route from Grenoble to Vizille is a VERY EASY route. Less than 2 hours of riding, approximately 20.5 km distance, and at max a 1-2% incline grade.\n\nYou can preview it here: https://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/4951451242/\n\nTrail path for (optional) hike that day: https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/france/isere/belvedere-de-vizille\n\nOnly 990 feet (333 meter) elevation increase/change. So we will barely break a sweat. But it should be a nice way to end the day.\n\n=== Alternative Transportation ===\nAlternatively, if you wish to join via Car or Bus (route Transisère X03)\n\nOur ETA window for arrival at Village Vizille center via Velo is estimated to be 10:15->10:30 AM. We can coalesce at the entrance to the museum.\n\n=== Agenda ===\n\n\\* Meet at Fontaine du Lion (105 Rue Saint-Laurent) from 08:30 to 09:00\n\\* First breakfast (packed) and coffee, fill your water, inspect your velo!\n\\* Depart at 08:45 +/- 15 minutes\n\\* 1.5 hours of leisurely cycling to Vizille\n\\* Second breakfast/Brunch upon arrival to keep up our blood sugar.\n\\* Straight to visit the Museum (inside the Castle / Château)\n\\* The museum closes at 12:30/noon/midi to visitors for 1 hours\n\\* Picnic: Second lunch: Relax in the beautifully manicured Victorian gardens & lawns under a shade tree and enjoy\n\\* A quick tour the Grounds/Parks (It is a mini Zoo, often with Swans and Peacocks on exhibit)\n\\* Then each member can decide how to proceed for the afternoon:\n\n* Take a small afternoon hike in the hills above the village (2-3 hours).\n* Cycle direct home to Grenoble\n* Bites & Beers & Coffee (or Bubble Tea!) in Grenoble\n\nRoad Cycling etiquette for the Ride:\n\n-) A helmet (casque) is an absolute requirement for this ride.\n-) Follow all traffic and bicycle laws\n-) Be respectful of pedestrians and especially elderly persons\n-) Stay together as a group (I will marshal us together based on observations)\n-) Please perform a basic mechanical check on your bicycle/velo the night before the event:\n\\- Inflate tires to 80\\-90% of rate PSI\n\\- Grease and lube your chain\n\\- Test the brakes function\n\\- Test your Bell\n\\- Charge or change the batteries in your lights\n\\- Locate your lock\\, helmet\\, gloves\\, sunglasses\\, etc\\. Safety First\\!\n-) Please make sure your bicycle has safety illumination (lights). The path takes a combination of road and cycle paths, but we should error on the side of caution always have lights activated when riding.\n-) Please bring bicycle safety gear: High Viz/Reflective Clothing, Gloves, Sunglasses!\n-) Charge your phone, bring a charger or spare battery, etc.\n-) Sunscreen / Solar protection\n-) Pack a Lunch and some small snacks, and eat a sufficient breakfast before!\n-) If you plan to come for the hike after, wear comfortable clothes and shoes, etc.\n-) WATER: Depending on your fitness, you may need to drink as much as to 3 liters of water. You can fill up at the Fountain du Lion before departure, and at the Museum Vizille there are public fountains are available.\n-) Stay together; we will figure out a pace comfortable for everyone\n-) Verbally call out any hazards that you spot (\"fait attention Hazards!!\", \"Car En face or Derrière!\", \"Pot hole!\", or \"Dog Poop!\")\n\nAnd of course, if anything goes wrong, call me directly on WhatsApp at: +1-412-378-3823 (WhatsApp) or +33 07 76 78 76 61 (French Mobile). Or call 15 for medical emergencies!",

    "description": "Hey Folks!\nGAC is back, so pack your bag. We are going, snowshoeing.🏔️\n\n== 🗨️ About us 🗨️ ==\n🦅/🐓 : we speak English/French in all our events. Don't be worry if your english/french is not that good. Nos events sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas \"suffisant\".\n== == == == == == == == == == == == == ==\n\nThe white mountains are shaking our hearts, lets shake back 😉💖\nWe will start from \"Station de ski du Sappey en Chartreuse\", wear the snowshoes, and hike untill we reach the amazing view at the top. The hike is just suitable to warm up the body after the confinement.\n\nRough plan:\n- gather at Notre-Dame Musée station at 9:15 am and socialize😉 (it is important to be at the station sooner because it will probably be crowded; we may not be able to get into the bus if we are the last people to join the queue).\n- take the bus 62 at 10:00 am .\n- take off the bus at le Sappey station\n- start the hike\n- have lunch + conversation + photos\n- walk a bit among the snowy tress, hunt some dragons!\n- walk and/or slide down\n- At 16:30 take the bus back to Grenoble (it's pitty we can't have a drink/snack/ice cream after the hike like before!)\n\nWhat to bring:\n- your smile\n- two balls and a carrot for our snowman (for the nose and the eyes, just to clear your dirty minds 😉😜 ) ☃️\n- waterproof gloves and hiking shoes\n- warm clothes\n- snowshoes\n- snow ploes (it is recommended to keep your balance)\n- lunch/snacks/hot drinks\n- luge, if you like to slide down a bit (you can find cheap showel luge, the slope is mild and safe, it is worth the try 😉 )\n- water\n- sunscreen cream\n\nYou are not equiped? No problem! we can rent the snowshoes and the poles from shops such as Adrenaline pro shop. We can get them on Friday evening and return them back afer the hike (just remember to have you ID and bank cards when renting the equipments).\n\nDon't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.",

A picnic up top!\n- Hat\n- Gloves\n- Sunglasses\n- PowerBank battery for mobile phone (ensures to charge it overnight !)\n- Small lights / flashlight\n- Any medicines or allergy treatments you may have pre-existing\n\n“Better to have and not need , then need a not Have.”\n\nThis is one of the easiest hike to do because we can take a bus to the western trail-head, take our time on the hike, and then decide to either:\n\n1) Take the last bus home from the start\n2) Just hike back to Grenoble (it is 7-8 km mostly downhill, but it is beautiful hike!\n-----\nDraft proposal for trail:\nhttps://www.alltrails.com/explore/map/map-b9a8f4a--31\n-----\n\nBackground: \"The three virgins\" (Les Trois Pucelles), a rock-face on the north-east corner of the Vercors, are named in honor of the three virgins from Grenoble that were sacrificed to appease the Dragon that lives in a cave on Saint-Nizier / Moucherotte.\n\nBack-story: Early Grenoblers, who had for centuries had lived in peace with the Dragon, had experienced a terrible famine (The \"eggplants\" wouldn't grow, so no Eggs for anyone). The situation was growing desperate. The famine made them \"hangry\", and so they had then tried to kill the Dragon 🐉 to eat.\n\n(I know ! Don't ask me! French cuisine evolved significantly after the Romans withdrew).\n\nAnyway, The Dragon was resentful, and was holding a grudge. He would fire bomb the town occasionally. Eventually, after many \"negotiations\", it was agreed to that three virgins from the town would be sacrificed from the edge of Moucherotte. As a result, the three rock fixtures were named in their honor.\n\nTo this day, the dragon still lives in Moucherotte, but he mostly leaves the Grenoblers alone. Occasionally he takes out a drone. Or a para-sailor. Stick close to the group! He only comes out at dawn and dusk.",

    "description": "NOTE: This event is on!! Please remember to mind your social distance rules and bring your masks when you’re not hiking.\n\nAn urban night hike above the city to catch the Harvest Moon in all of its celestial magnificence from a spot high above the city.\n\nAs you can observe, it is getting darker earlier. By 1st October, we will have safety from the local dragons by 18:00. Shadows = Safety.\n\nSunset tonight is at 20:13, but, by 1st October, Sunset it at 19:16!\n\nThis will be a hike at on a Thursday night; so you'll probably want to WFH on Friday, or tell your boss about with a soft-start time. I will try make sure we are on a return tram by 23:30\n\nTHE PATH IS SET!\n\nThere are 3 well known paths from Grenoble to the Bastile.\nThere is one less well known, and that's the one for us!\n- https://www.alltrails.com/explore/map/map-da0b566--45\n- https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/3413049679\n\nFor now, know That you will need a headlamp to navigate the trail, and a thermos of something warm to drink at the top 🍵 ☕️\n\nIf you do not have a head-light:\n\n- https://www.amazon.fr/Petzl-Tikka-Lampe-Frontale-Adulte/dp/B01KYTQKBE\n- https://www.amazon.fr/Petzl-Lampe-frontale-Reactik-Orange/dp/B01FIDI4UQ\n- https://www.amazon.fr/Petzl-E099GA01-Lampe-Frontale-Unique/dp/B07T5RLZTX\n\n(Do not waste your money on a non-Petzl light!)\n\nNOTE: MASKS ARE MANDATORY! MASKS ARE MANDATORY!\nHave a mask with you ready to dawn when the group is not moving!\nIf you're hiking up the Bastille? You're exercising. If you've stopped\nto admire the moon, you're not exercising :) The police may\nbe wanting to give you a hard time.\n\n= General Plan =\n- 17:45-18:00 Meet at the Fountain (Water, Beer, Cafe available at the local pub)\n- 18:00 Walk to Port de France\n- 18:15 Hike up the mountain to the memorial (1.5 hours)\n- 19:45-20:20 Warn Drinks Small Snacks and enjoy the moon, as well as any other astronomical elements that can be observed.\n- 20:20 Hike back to Grenoble city center\n(1 primary exit option, 3 possible exit options)\n- NOTE: Leave the memorial absolutely no later than 20:20 to assure you are through the gates at the Bastille by 20:45)\n(This is France, some person could just arbitrarily decide to lock the gate early, like its a mom & pop boutique that sells petite hand-painted statuettes of Dragons)",

We will also visit the “Vertige des Cimes”, a metal grid platform that gives a thrilling view of the valley below (not recommended for those who are afraid of heights). At the top of Pic Saint-Michel, we will enjoy the panorama if the sky is clear. Then we will slide down to the ski station. 🛷\nDon’t forget to wear warm hiking shoes and why not put plastic bags inside to keep your feet dry.

It will be a nice warm-up for us 😊. Then we’ll follow a trail and enter the forest 🌲. We’ll go up and reach the town of Jarrie. There we’ll see the castle “Château de bon repos” 🏰. We can take a break there and have our lunch 🍽️.\n\nAfter that, we’ll continue our hike and climb a little more. We’ll try to find some chestnuts 🌰 along the way. I hope there are some left, and that they are not too small or eaten by worms 😬. We’ll enjoy a \"beautiful\" view over Champ-sur-Drac 🌄.\n\nThen we’ll cross the village of Champagnier.

And in my opinion, it is open for beginners. There is no \"extreme\" difficulty. You will have to row your boat with another people. No need to have a lot of muscles, cause the river will push you gently until the end of the 20km.\n\n❗❗ It's MANDATORY to know how to swim. At least 25 meters with your head temporary under the water. See https://canoe-grenoble.com/infos-pratiques/ (READ IT)\n\nNote that we won't have any shadow during the whole afternoon.

We will park our car(s) at the parking of the canyoning.\n\n== ❔🧗‍♂️ What do you need for speleology ❔🧗‍♂️ ==\n✔️ A specific suit, socks and helmet will be provided by the guide\n- A swim suit + towel : 🩱 /🩳\n- Sport shoes which can go into water\n- A water proof camera (Go pro type) if you have one\n- Water and a picnic for after the activity 😋\n- Your smile 😁 / Happiness 😊\n- 💵 Money in cash for car share + the activity\n\n== After the event ==\nIf you feel like it, we will share our picnic next to the canyon and afterthat we can share a drink, a pizza or an ice cream in town depending on the mood of the crowd.\n\n== 😷 Covid rules 😷 ==\n- Don't come if you feel sick, have fever, are contact case,...\n- As always, wear your mask (we will not wear the mask during the activity 😉)\n- You are responsible of your own health, so respect barrier gestures, social distancing, ...\n- All rules: https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19\n\n-----------------------\nIf you have any question, please let me know!\nSi vous avez des questions, faites moi signe!\n\nA samedi,\nJulien from GAC",

If you are late and this big gate is closed you can go back in Grenoble by the main car road (https://s.42l.fr/FsQLrrr0) but it will be longer. Once you passed the big gate at top of Bastille, there is no other closed gate if you follow the same track that we used to go up (https://s.42l.fr/VciaZ431).

We may need to encircle the lake en Velo to find a good spot. Please bring a few euros in case they're charging an entrance fee.\n\n=== Note 📝 ===\n\nI'm looking for riders/persons more-familiar with Lake Paladru, as I've never ridden there myself, so I'm unfamiliar with the best beaches/spots for swimming/picnic. I understand some of them are private….\n\n=== What to Bring ===\n\n\\* Water, 2L minimum (there should be fountains along the way; we'll make note of them for future events)\n\\* Snacks (Proteins and Complex Carbohydrates)\n\\* ID Wallet etc. 💰 💵 💷\n\\* Cash/Cards\n\\* Any medications you have\n\\* Bicycle Safety: Gloves/Gants, Lunettes/Eye Protection.

The track to Pinéa is covered by trees so expected to be icy-snow, and muddy as usual.

Very steep path with snow on top\n* 🔵 OK for good hikers\n\nWe are going to drive for about 50 minutes and get to the town of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse. There is a ski resort there but it is shut down because of money problems. That’s why we can hike in the ski resort and get to the top. 🏔️ We will begin our walk from the village by following the river Guiers Mort. 🚶‍♂️ Then we will start our hard climb to the top and do our 950 meters of elevation in one go, but we will probably take some breaks on the way up. 😅 On the top, we should enjoy a 360 view over Chartreuse. 😍 Then the way down should be quicker as we can maybe slide down on the snow until the half of the ski resort. 🛷 Then we will have to keep hiking down in the forest and then back to our starting point. 🌲\n\n🗺️ Topo & GPX track: [https://s.42l.fr/B-WDpxYh](https://s.42l.fr/B-WDpxYh) (click Export > GPX)\n📲 Download GPX on your phone (Tuto: [https://binnette.github.io/GAC](https://binnette.github.io/GAC/))\n📏 Distance: 9.7km\n⏱️ Time: \\~4/5h of hike\n📈 D+: 948m 🐱‍👓\n\n== 📜 Rules 📜 ==\n\n* 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️ GAC is about hiking 🥾 and making friends 🤗, NOT flirting ⛔\n* 🚮 No littering in nature.

I have chosen a lower mountain to avoid any danger of avalanches and snow on the road. We will drive our cars for 40 minutes and park at the village of Saint-Jean-de-Vaulx. 🚗🚙 From there, we will begin our climb and pass by a small hamlet called les Arnauds. 🏘️ We will keep hiking until we reach the mountain named Beauregard (which means good looking eyes in English). 👀 We will go down and up again until la Peyrouse, which is the highest point of our journey (1710m). 🏔️ We will have our lunch break there and admire the view. 🍽️👌 Then we will start sliding down and walking down until another small hamlet named le Villaret. 🛷🚶‍♂️ From there, we will follow a path along the road to get back to our cars. 🛣️ I hope to see you for this adventure! 🙌\n\n🗺️ Topo & GPX track: [https://s.42l.fr/j1OmXr_W](https://s.42l.fr/j1OmXr_W) (click Export > GPX)\n📲 Download GPX on your phone (Tuto: [https://binnette.github.io/GAC](https://binnette.github.io/GAC/))\n📏 Distance: 15km\n⏱️ Time: \\~4/5h of hike\n📈 D+: 763m\n\n== 📜 Rules 📜 ==\n\n* 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️ GAC is about hiking 🥾 and making friends 🤗, NOT flirting ⛔\n* 🚮 No littering in nature.

    "description": "⌚Updates🎙️⏩\n\n📌 Saturday 16 October 07:00 PM:\n4 cars, max 18 hikers: Áine (5), Leo (4), Djilali (4), Cindy (5)\n\n📌 Friday 15 October 03:55 PM:\n1 car, max 5 hikers: Áine (5)\n\n⏪\n\nA short hike along a ski trail (without snow of course), probably with a good view at the top! + card game depending on how many we are\n\nTwo points about this event:\n1. You can skip the zipline and simply descend by walking.\n2. Ziplining is limited to one person every 10 minutes, so reserve your spot😉\n\n💣 What to expect 💣\ncheck these links out:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=417773519511641\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WlGchmepAc&t=48s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb4AjgEsMbA\nhttps://autrans-meaudre.com/fr/ete/activites/zipline-vercors-2/\n\n🗺️ About the trail 🗺️\nTopo & GPX track of the hike: https://s.42l.fr/VNU65khi\n▶💡 Download GPX track on your phone.\nDistance: 6 km\nTime: ~2/3h of hike + 1h lunch + 2h 🚗\nD+: ~ 550 m\nThe trail is straightforward, I just see some dug channels along the way which probably we can avoid.\n\n📜 Rough plan 📜\n~ 08:30 - 09:00 AM: Socializing.\n\n@ 09:00 AM: Leave the Parking Public Clemenceau\nin PPM.\n\n~ 10:00 AM: Park the car(s) and start the hike.\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/GHdg5ioyST4eYhuo9\n\n~ 12:00 AM: Reach the top.\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/p8aUoWDnvUQGnK7h9\n\n~ 02:00 PM: Be back to the car parking and get rid of the backpacks for hikers who have booked the ziplining.\n\n~ 03:00 PM: Be at the starting station of the ziplining.\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/CKR5Xw9ctkPkHX8K6\n\nThe ending time of the event depends on the number of hikers willing to do the ziplining. At most, we can be 13 people doing the zipline, which makes others wait for 2 hours. If this would be the case, we can play games and/or just chill in the town until everybody is back.\n\n🎫 Don't forget 🎫\nAs soon as you are confirmed to join us, reserve your ziplining ticket at the following link:\nhttps://autrans-meaudre.com/fr/ete/activites/zipline-vercors-2/vente-en-ligne-zipline/\n\n(click on the next available slot after 15h00, choose \"Zipline Seule\", add it to your cart and pay; the price is 19 €):\nwe will experience 1250 m of ziplining with 250 m vertical drop and a speed of 70 km / h.\n\n🎒 What to bring 🎒\n- Your smile and positive vibe\n- Suitable shoes for an easy hike\n- Water + lunch + snack\n- (Sunscreen + sunglasses + hat)\n- Face mask\n- Cash for car-sharing (5€ per person to cover both the fuel and the toll in our round trip)\n\n💡 Rules 💡\n- Don't throw any dump in nature!\n- Be on time.\n- If you are not a driver, remember you are reserving a seat in a car, so please don't subscribe if you are not determined to join us. However, if you had to cancel your subscription, please unsubscribe from the event, we need to know how many people are coming.\n- If you are a driver and have to cancel your subscription, please send me a message through meetup ASAP so that I can remove available seats.\n- You are responsible for your own health and security\n- Covid rules: https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19\n\nAbout us🥾🚣🏊🚴🏓🎿🛷🧗‍♀️🥊\nWe are a bunch of awesome people doing cool stuff😎\n\nWe speak English/French in all our events. Don't be worry if your English/French is not that good. Nos évènements sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas \"suffisant\".\n\n💌Don't hesitate to shoot me a message if you have any questions NOT mentioned in the announcement! 🙂💌\n\nHassan\n\nPS: for more activities (cinema, tennis table, concert, etc), you can join our WhatsApp group. Just ask me by message on meetup or IRL (in real life).",

Votre mission si vous l’acceptez, sera de trouver les indices cachés dans tous les recoins de la Bastille et solutionner toutes les énigmes pour parvenir à la désamorcer.\n\nVéritable escape game mobile sur la Bastille, il va mobiliser votre communication, éprouver votre cohésion et solliciter votre sang froid !!!\nVotre équipe a besoin de vous !!!\n\nInfo: https://acrobastille.fr/bastille-aventures/escape-game-mobile/\n\n================================\n\nSECOND 🥈: We will do the acrobastille course which is crazy ❗ 🤪\n\nPlus de limites pour vous ! Tous les parcours sont maintenant à votre portée !!\n\nEn réalisant les circuits vert 🟢, bleu 🔵, rouge 🔴, noir ⚫ et violet 🟣, vous allez en voir de toutes les couleurs 🌈🌈 !\n\nVenez donc vous confronter aux chemins cachés dans une partie méconnue de la bastille tout en jouant avec la gravité. Et cerise sur le gâteau, les tyroliennes géantes vous offriront une vue splendide sur Grenoble et ses massifs environnants.\n\nA vous l’adrénaline et les sensations fortes ❗❗❗\n\nInfo: https://acrobastille.fr/parcours-ados-adultes/\n\n================================\n\nBoth of these events should take about 3-4 hours combined (1+/- hour for escape game and 2+/- hours for acrobastille)\n\nWe will meet at 13h - or 1pm normal time ;) at the Fontaine du Lion. It is next to the Bastille and you can find exact location below in the meeting place map.\n\nIf there are any questions - especially about if there will be dragons 🐉 you can contact Brian directly.\n\nBisous 😘\n\n- Team GAC",

    "description": "Update on the 19/08/2020 - 2pm: As indicated by Fiflo38100 (thanks for the tip), we cannot take the bus from notre dame musée. The meeting point is thus shifted to \"l'ile verte\" stop. It's at the school bus next to the school Paul Bert on the avenue Maréchal Rondon.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\nThe GAC tries to keep the rythm and post an activity every weekend. Next Saturday is no exception with a combo of 3 activities. Don't let this opportunity pass you by!\n\n== 🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️ ==\n🦅/🐓 : we speak English/French in all our events. Don't be worry if your english/french is not that good. Nos events sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas \"suffisant\".\n\n==================\nAre you ready for some Amazing Accrobranching, Sweet Swimming and Hiking?? Don't worry if the title of this event frightened you, this event should be accessible to everyone 😉.\n\nHere's the rough plan of the day:\n10h00: Departure from notre dame musée by bus 62\n10h30: Arrival at le sappey\n11h00: Start of the accrobranche activity 🌳\n14h00: End of accrobranche + lunch\n14h30: Departure for the hike 🥾\n18h42: Arrival at Le Hameau de Vence to take the (last) bus 62 back to Grenoble\n19h00: Back in Grenoble for drinks and food ;) 🍔/🍺\n\n====== Details ======\n🌳: For those who don't know what Accrobranch is, it can be summarized as playing to Tarzan (but in a totally safe manner because you are attached by cables to the trees). It's a lot of fun and adventure. The cost is 22 euro cash on-site. No credit card. Gloves and equipment provided on-site.\n\n🥾: We will go around the Ecoutoux mount for an easy hike. If we are good with the timing, there should be a swimming opportuniy at pont de Vence (water might be cold though 😉).\n- Duration: 3h\n- Distance: 7km\n- Slope (Denivelé): + 340m/-530m\nmore details here: https://www.visorando.com/randonnee-/3802497\n\n== ❔ What do you need ❔ ==\n- sport shoes + backpack\n- water (2/3liters)\n- sunglasses, hat, sunscreen\n- lunch\n- swimsuit + towel if you plan to swim\n\n====⚠️====\nOnce you register, you engage to come because a reservation has been made. In case of late cancelation (and if no one could replace you), you will be asked to pay your share of the costs. Event limited to 12 people due to covid measure at the Accrobranche.\n\n============\nBecause le sappey is accessible by bus you can leave also after the accrobranche if you are on a tight schedule.\n\nThis will be an experience and challenge for all of us. No time estimates are 100% accurate as we will need to adjust to the needs of others. But one thing that is certain is we will all have fun and stay safe together!\n\nDon't hesitate if you have questions (in french or english).\nN'hésitez pas si vous avez des questions.\n--\nLeila and Julien for the GAC",

    "description": "[Event moved from the Museum Circuit group to here, appended with Hike]\n\nHi all!\n\nAsk yourself: How does a Bougie chateau in the south of France act as a symbol for the French Revolution, which removed [the heads of] the aristocracy ??\n\nCome find out for yourself!\n\nLate August we will return to Vizille; for some of us, this is a chance to finish visiting the remainder of the Museum and enjoy the last of the long summer days.\n\nPack a lunch picnic and pump of your velo's tyres! On-Y-Va!\n\n--\n\n( You, of course, are welcome to join via Car or Bus! Our ETA window\nfor arrival at Village Vizille is 10:15->10:30 AM)\n\nDetails about the museum (en Anglais!): https://www.grenoble-tourisme.com/en/discover/essentials/domaine-de-vizille/\n\nThe velo route from Grenoble to Vizille is VERY EASY. Less than 2 hrs, 20.5 Km, and at max a 1-2% incline grade outgoing, and even easier returning. You can preview it here: https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/3351881878\n\nTrail path for (optional) hike that day: https://www.alltrails.com/explore/map/map-4b04a68--33 Only 990 feet (333 meter) elevation increase/change. So we will barely break a sweat. But it should be a nice way to end the day.\n\nAgenda:\n\n-) Meet at Fontaine du Lion (105 Rue Saint-Laurent) by the Bakery between 08:00 and 08:30\n-) First breakfast (packed) and coffee, fill your water, inspect your velo!\n-) Depart at 08:30 +/- 10 minutes\n-) Second Breakfast: A quick stop at Boulangerie Pâtisserie Traiteur - Maison Lenoir (5 Rue Ampère, 38000 Grenoble just of Crs Berriat/St. Bruno) -- This is because Boulangerie Pâtisserie La Cymaise near Foundtain Du Lyon is closed for Vacance/Vacation.\n-) 1.5 Hours of cycling to Vizille\n-) First Lunch/Brunch: Quickly\n-) Visit the Museum (Castle / Château)\n-) The museum closes at 12:00 to visitors for 1 hours\n-) Second lunch: Relax in the beautiful Victorian lawns under a shade tree and enjoy\n-) Tour the Grounds/Park\n-) Then each member can decide:\n- Take a small hike in the hills above the castle.\n- Cycle home to Grenoble (Petite Group)\n-) Third lunch.\n-) Cycle back to Grenoble (main group)\n-) Bites & Beers & Coffee (Or Bubble Tea!) in Grenoble\n\nRules for the Museum/Grounds:\n\n-) Follow all French Government rules for social distancing and COVID-19 virus transfer mitigation (Wash Hands, Wear Face Masks, Physical Distance, etc.)\n-) Follow all safety rules posted at the Museum!\n-) Be Polite !\n\nRules for the Ride:\n\n-) Please perform a basic mechanical check on your bicycle/velo the night before! (Inflate tires to 80-90% of rate PSI, grease/lube the chain, test the brakes function, etc.)\n-) Please make sure your bicycle has illumination (Lights). The path takes a combination of road and cycle paths, but we should error on the side of caution always have lights activated when riding.\n-) Please bring bicycle safety gear: High Viz Clothing, Helmet / Cask (REQUIRED!), Gloves, Sunglasses!\n-) Charge your phone, Spare battery, etc.\n-) Sunscreen / Solar protection\n-) Pack a Lunch (1-to-4), and some small snacks, and eat a sufficient meal before!\n-) If you plan to come for the hike, bring a whistle, wear comfortable shoes, etc.\n-) WATER: Depending on your fitness, you may need up to 3 liters of water. You can fill up at the fountain before departure, and at the Museum public fountains are available.\n-) Stay together; we will figure out a pace comfortable for everyone\n-) Verbally call out any hazards that you spot (\"fait attention!!\", \"Car Back/Derrière!\", \"Pot hole!\")\n\nAnd of course, if anything goes crazy, call me direct: +1-412-378-3823 (WhatsApp) or +33 07 76 78 76 61 (Mobile), or at my name on Facebook Messenger.",

    "description": "Update on the 10/08 - 13h00: This party is just getting started!! 4 more seats are available (we will be eight in total), don't miss this opportunity!\n\n-----------\nHi all, salut à toutes/tous,\n\nLets go canyoning in Vercors! For those who don't know what canyoning is, it's basically advancing in a river usually inside a canyon by all means :)\nThis includes: jumping in water (saut), sliding (toboggans) and rappel (descente en rappel),... So you need to know how to swim to participate!\n\nWe will open the event for 4 people total (as reservations have been made).\n\nTwo of us are already going, so there are only places for 2 more people!\n\nThe activity will be in the Furon river next to Grenoble, it lasts 5.5-6h including lunch break.\nThe cost per person is 75€ (it includes the guide + equipment) - but if 6 or more people decide to join it is reduced to 65€ per person. So lets get more people to participate! :)\n\nIMPORTANT: Once you register, you engage to come because a booking was made to the company!\n\nIf more than 4 people wish to participate it's no problem but we need to know as soon as possible! The professionnal guide will only take a limited amount of people, and others outside of our group are sure to reserve their place!\n\nThe two of us are beginners, so this will be a real adventure! ;)\n-----------\nInfo below:\n\nL’intégral du Furon constitue une descente sportive de plus de 5h de Canyoning.\n\nL'accès à ce canyon est très pratique, 20 minutes seulement depuis Grenoble et 45 minutes par l'autoroute depuis Lyon\n\nC’est donc l’enchainement de la partie haute et de la partie basse du canyon du Furon, entrecoupé d’une pause casse-croûte.\n\nOn profitera alors des plus beaux obstacles de chacun des deux parcours, à savoir de beaux sauts, toboggans, siphons (non obligatoires), et rappels.\n\nLe canyon est bien homogène, progessivité dans les sauts, dans les descentes en rappel (maximum 18m) et les obstacles sont d'une grande variété !\n\nLink to exact details below:\nhttps://www.vertical-aventure.com/fr/canyoning/canyon-furon-integral-grenoble-lyon-vercors\n\n-------\nOrganisationtional details:\n\nWe will meet at the train station on Saturday morning. Easy for all to access by tram or bus. Also open parking for the drivers.\n\nWhat to bring:\n- Sport shoes that don't mind going into water\n- Water (1 or 2L)\n- Swim suit\n- Snacks\n- Compact lunch (no big boxes, it need to fit in a small place).\n\nAny other questions, please ask!\nSi vous avez des questions n'hésitez pas!\n\nSee you Saturday the 15th!",

    "description": "🎰🎰🎰 Same player, play again! Yesterday it was raining. Hopefully tonight is gonna be OK 🎰🎰🎰\n\n== 🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️ ==\n🦅/🐓 : we speak English/French in all our events. Don't be worry if your english is not that good. Nos events sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas \"suffisant\".\n\n==🧗‍♀️ Via ferrata 'Les prises de la Bastille' 🧗‍♂️==\nWe will do \"Les prises de la Bastille\", the 1st part for sure (the 2nd part is an option).\nThe 1st part is rated as rather difficult to difficult and lasts for 1h. The 2nd part is rated difficult to very difficult and is more technical and physical. It also last 1h. You can escape between both part if you are tired or don't want to continue.\nAll the details are here: https://www.viaferrata-fr.net/via-ferrata-1-Les-Prises-de-la-Bastille-Grenoble-Is%E8re.html\n\n== ⚠️ Rent or bring your equipment! ⚠️ ==\nIf you don't have it already, you'll need to rent your Via Ferrata equipment (casque+baudrier+longes).\n\nFor example, you can go to the shop \"Adrénaline Sport\" near the cinema Pathé Chavant, \"Takamaka\" on the quai near \"Jardin de Ville\" or \"La Randonnée\" near the tram stop \"Gustave Rivet\". You should try the equipment into the shop to see if it suit you well. It costs between 10 to 15€ for 1 day.\n\nThis event is free except for the renting of the equipment.\n\n== ❔ What do you need ❔ ==\n- Via Ferrata equipment : casque+baudrier+longes\n- A good pair of shoes (hiking shoes are highly recommended otherwise you may slip on the rocks)\n- Some water\n- Some snack only if you want\n- Headlamp (in case we are really too slow)\n\n== 🤓 Initiation to Via Ferrata 🤓 ==\n\nI (Albin) am not a guide and i will not be responsible of you or your security. But I will teach you how to do Via Ferrata safely. I'm also used to do Via Ferrata with totally beginners, so I will ensure that you can complete the Via Ferrata safely.\n\nFor safety reason, I will limit the group to a maximum of 5 people including me.\n\n== 🍔 After 🍔 ==\n\nIf you feel like it, we can have a drink/some food after the climbing.\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask!\n\nSee you tonigth.

You can do this at the “Adrenaline Sport” shop 🏬 near Parc Paul Mistral. Their website is http://www.adrenaline-ski-shop.com/magasins and their opening hours are 10-12:30pm and 2:30-7pm.

May be you can find another shop if you prefer...\n\nAfter the event, you can return the equipment to “Domino’s Pizza” 🍕 at the corner. You can find their location here: https://osm.org/go/0CASD82h9?m=\n\n== 🧗‍♂️🔴 Via-Ferrata: 🥾 then 🏊‍♀️ in Lacs Robert 🥶 and finally 2x🧗‍♂️ ==\nBeginners are welcome. There are 2 via ferrata. The second is not mandatory. The via are not very difficult, but we will hike until the Robert lakes, so beginners will probably already be tired before starting the Via. But we will probably lunch break at the lake before starting the via.\n\nDo you love hiking, climbing, and swimming in the mountains? If yes, then this hike is for you! Join me for an adventure in Chamrousse. We will start from Le Recoin 🎿, and hike to Lac des Pourettes 🌲, a peaceful lake/swamp in the forest. From there, we will hike to Lacs Roberts 💙, three gorgeous alpine lakes with crystal clear water. Here we will swim in the cold water ❄️ (if you are brave enough!) and have lunch. Then we will do the first via ferrata 🧗‍♂️ On top, we will cross the brand new Himalayan bridge 🌉, a 130-meter-long walkway that hangs over the valley. If you want, you can do the second via ferrata or chill at the Cross of Chamrousse ✝️, a monument that stands at the highest point of the ski area. Then we will hike back to Le Recoin 🌅, enjoying some drinks and the fresh air before going back to Grenoble 🚗.\n\n🗺️ Topo & GPX track: [https://s.42l.fr/tt7suvyY](https://s.42l.fr/tt7suvyY) (click Export > GPX)\n📲 Download GPX on your phone (Tuto: [https://binnette.github.io/GAC](https://binnette.github.io/GAC/))\n📏 Distance: 11.5km\n⏱️ Time: \\~4/5h of hike\n📈 D+: 800m\n\n==== First Via-Ferrata ====\n[https://www.viaferrata-fr.net/via-ferrata-81-La-via-ferrata-des-Lacs-Roberts-Chamrousse-Is%E8re.html](https://www.viaferrata-fr.net/via-ferrata-81-La-via-ferrata-des-Lacs-Roberts-Chamrousse-Is%E8re.html)\nLevel: 3 on 6\nDuration: \\~1h30\nDistance: 300m\nD+: 150m\n\n==== Second Via-Ferrata ====\n[https://www.viaferrata-fr.net/via-ferrata-3-Via-ferrata-des-3-Fontaines-Chamrousse-Is%E8re.html](https://www.viaferrata-fr.net/via-ferrata-3-Via-ferrata-des-3-Fontaines-Chamrousse-Is%E8re.html)\nLevel: 2-3 on 6\nDuration: \\~1h\nDistance: 350m\nD+: 40m\n\n== 📜 Rules 📜 ==\n\n* 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️ GAC is about hiking 🥾 and making friends 🤗, NOT flirting ⛔\n* 🚮 Don't litter in nature, even fruit peel.

    "description": "Lets make this Saturday awesome together🏔️😍\nMaybe recharge ourselves before the third confinement, and hope it would not be our last kiss to the Mouth of the Mountains in a Month🤕☹️\n\n📜📜📜 Here is the rough plan:📜📜📜\n06:45 : meet at the train station and buy the bus tickets\n07:25 : take the bus 6010\n09:00 : take off the bus at Chamrousse 1750 station and start\nsnowshoeing towards lac Achard\n12:00 : by this time we should have returned, so we would have time to\ndo snowtubing and/or sledging\n13:00 : eat lunch\n13:45 : take the bus 6010 back to Grenoble\n15:00 : take off the bus at the train station in Grenoble\n\n🥾🥾🥾About the trail:🥾🥾🥾\nIt is around 7 km with 300 elevation difference, so it is considered as a moderate hike.\n\n🍩🍩🍩About the snowtubing:🍩🍩🍩\nIt is completely safe and easy to do. You can find more information here:\nhttps://www.chamrousse.com/tube-park-snowtubing.html\n\n🎒🎒🎒What to bring:🎒🎒🎒\n- your smile!\n- waterproof gloves and hiking shoes\n- warm clothes\n- snowshoes\n- snow ploes (it is recommended to keep your balance)\n- lunch/snacks/hot drinks\n- luge, if you like to do sledging also\n- water\n- sunscreen cream\n\nJust like the previous times, if you don't have your own snowshoes, you can rent the snowshoes and the poles from shops such as Adrenaline pro shop, skitruck, etc. We can get them on Friday evening and return them back after the hike (just remember to have you ID and bank cards when renting the equipments).\n\nDon't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.",
