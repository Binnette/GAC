# What about the hikes?

## About hikes difficulty

Usually, I put a 'color circle' in the events title. That way, you can have a quick idea about the hike difficulty:

- 🟢 Easy 🐢
- 🔵 Medium 🐭
- 🔴 Hard 🐇
- ⚫ Hardcore ☠

But know that you should take a look to the "topo map". Usually I put a link in each hike description for you to look to the map and even [download the GPS track on your phone](../TutoOsmAnd/README.md). The two main info, you want to look for are:

- The total length of the hike in kilometers (km)
- The positive elevation (D+)

Also you can have a look to the slope. There should be a button (with a mountain logo) on the map to display the slope of the hike.

About slope, imagine two hikes (A & B) with the same length (10km) and the same D+ (300m):

```
300m ‾   /‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾\             Hike B
200m ‾  /       Hike A       \       /‾‾\        /‾‾\
100m ‾ /                      \  /‾‾‾    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾    ‾‾‾\
```

Event if they have the same length and same amount of positive elevation:
hike A will be more difficult because you will do all the elevation at once.
For hike B, you do the same amount of elevation but 'step by step', so you have time to 'rest' and breathe between each 'steps'.
