# What about the hikes?

## About hikes difficulty

Usually, I put a 'color circle' in the events title. That way, you can have a quick idea about the hike difficulty:

- 🟢 Easy 🐢
- 🔵 Medium 🐭
- 🔴 Hard 🐇
- ⚫ Hardcore ☠

But know that you should take a look to the "topo map". Usually I put a link in each hike description for you to look to the map and even [download the GPS track on your phone](../TutoOsmAnd/README.md). The two main info, you want to look for are:

- The total length of the hike in kilometers (km)
- The positive elevation (D+)

Also you can have a look to the slope. There should be a button (with a mountain logo) on the map to display the slope.
