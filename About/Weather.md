# Hiking Guide with Weather Considerations 🌄

## Where is the Snow? ❄️

To find out where the snow is, I use several resources:

- **[Ventuski](https://www.ventusky.com/?p=45.175;5.764;10&l=snow)** 🌐: This website provides a snow cover layer that helps me visualize snow conditions.
- **[Windy](https://www.windy.com/fr/-%C3%89paisseur-de-neige-snowcover?snowcover,45.201,5.791,10,m:eUnagkZ)** 🌬️: Another great tool with a snow cover layer for real-time updates.
- **[Copernicus](https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/?zoom=10&lat=45.11765&lng=5.93811&themeId=DEFAULT-THEME&visualizationUrl=U2FsdGVkX19R0amL0jKEsuuBh%2F3JcJR9BwUipJZi4epCIXsHgAeaKJzRbLogg2DST5gpk0b2Kgf04iT2qVrpohtbBj0WnUX8skes7H1OUJ0VLLJh2TatyCR5Vo8ReWcQ&datasetId=S2_L2A_CDAS&demSource3D=%22MAPZEN%22&cloudCoverage=30&dateMode=SINGLE)** 🌍 or **[EO Browser](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/?zoom=10&lat=45.13892&lng=5.62775&themeId=DEFAULT-THEME&toTime=2025-02-05T17%3A39%3A40.894Z)** 🛰️: These platforms offer up-to-date aerial imagery, allowing me to see if there is snow. However, be cautious! Many satellite images may have clouds ☁️, which can be misleading. Always double-check to avoid confusing snow with cloud cover.
- **Webcams** 📷: I check various mountain webcams, especially at major ski resorts. These live feeds give a good indication of snow levels, fog, or cloud presence.

## Risk of Avalanches ⚠️

**🚨 Warning: In any doubt, just don't go! Avalanches are deadly. 🚨**

For avalanche risk assessment, I rely on:

- **[YETI (Camptocamp)](https://www.camptocamp.org/yeti)** ☃️: A bit tricky to use but very usefull.
- **[Meteo France](https://meteofrance.com/meteo-montagne/alpes-du-nord/risques-avalanche)** 🌧️: Their mountain weather section offers valuable insights into avalanche risks in the Northern Alps.

## Quality of Snow 🌨️

When it comes to snowshoeing, timing is everything! Here are my recommendations:

- **Fresh Snow** ❄️: I highly recommend going out shortly after a fresh snowfall. The experience is much more enjoyable on soft, powdery snow.
- **Ice Caution** 🧊: Be aware that overnight, fresh snow can turn into ice. Using snowshoes on ice is not as fun and can be quite challenging.

## About Thunder ⛈️

I once canceled a hike due to a severe thunderstorm forecasted in the Belledonne range. I was grateful for that decision, as the thunder was followed by large hailstones 🌨️. A few days later, hikers who were caught in the storm shared their terrifying experience of seeking shelter under trees and rocks. Always prioritize safety when thunderstorms are predicted!

## About Rain ☔

To avoid rain during my hikes, I use **Meteoblue** 🌦️. Here’s how:

- **[Meteoblue Website](https://www.meteoblue.com/fr/meteo/semaine/grenoble_france_3014728)** (or mobile app): You can find forecasts for specific locations, including Grenoble. 
- **[Meteoblue Where2Go](https://www.meteoblue.com/fr/meteo/outdoorsports/where2go/grenoble_france_3014728)** 🌍: This tool is incredibly useful! You select a city (e.g., Grenoble), choose the day of your hike, and set a radius (30, 60, 100 km, etc.). The map will show you the best places to go for more sun and hopefully avoid rain.
- **Ventusky** 🌪️: I also use this tool for a second opinion on weather forecasts.

## About Drinking Water 💧

In the summer, finding drinking water in the nearby mountains can be challenging:

- **Dry Sources** 🚫: Many water sources tend to dry up, especially in the Chartreuse and Vercors ranges.
- **Belledonne** 🏔️: In contrast, Belledonne is generally more reliable for water, thanks to the ice on top of the peaks that slowly melts, providing a consistent water supply.
