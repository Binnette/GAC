Since this session is dedicated to noobs, I will try to make you climb without buying a lot of stuff.



### ⭐ What do you need (mandatory)

   1. Really good shoes, not slippery. Because you will climb with those shoes. So If you have hiking shoes or any mountain shoes, then take them. Otherwise you can buy climbing shoes, see my advises below.
   1. A short. Way better than trousers...
   1. That's all. Bring beers, food, games if you want.


### ✨ What do you need (not mandatory but truly advised especially if you want to practice climbing regularly)

   1. Number 1 priority: climbing shoes ~35€ [https://www.decathlon.fr/p/chaussons-d-escalade-rock/\_/R-p-8899](https://www.decathlon.fr/p/chaussons-d-escalade-rock/\_/R-p-8899)
   * If your feet size is 41 then take 41. And try the shoes in the shop. You must be "comfortable" in your shoes, if the shoes are too tiny, then take a bigger size 41 to 42 or 43 or so on.
   1. Number 2 priority: harness ~35€ [https://www.decathlon.fr/p/harnais-escalade-easy-3-bleu/\_/R-p-143818](https://www.decathlon.fr/p/harnais-escalade-easy-3-bleu/\_/R-p-143818)
   * Test the harness to see if you are "comfortable" inside
   1. Number 3 priority: helmet ~25€ [https://www.decathlon.fr/p/casque-d-escalade-et-d-alpinisme-rock/\_/R-p-137025](https://www.decathlon.fr/p/casque-d-escalade-et-d-alpinisme-rock/\_/R-p-137025)
   1. Number 4 priority: "belay device" (descendeur) + carabiner 
       1. Belay device ~12€ [https://www.decathlon.fr/p/karo/\_/R-p-192777](https://www.decathlon.fr/p/karo/\_/R-p-192777)
       1. Carabiner type "screw locker" ~7€ [https://www.decathlon.fr/p/mousqueton-a-vis-rocky/\_/R-p-130435](https://www.decathlon.fr/p/mousqueton-a-vis-rocky/\_/R-p-130435)
