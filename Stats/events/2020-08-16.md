# Return à Vizille (via Vélo) - Museum of the French Revolution + Hike

![2020-08-16](/Stats/img/orig/2020-08-16.jpg)

[Event moved from the Museum Circuit group to here, appended with Hike]

Hi all!

Ask yourself: How does a Bougie chateau in the south of France act as a symbol for the French Revolution, which removed [the heads of] the aristocracy ??

Come find out for yourself!

Late August we will return to Vizille; for some of us, this is a chance to finish visiting the remainder of the Museum and enjoy the last of the long summer days.

Pack a lunch picnic and pump of your velo's tyres! On-Y-Va!
