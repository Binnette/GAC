## 🧗‍♂️🔴⚔️Via ferrata: Attack the 🏰Bastille with bravery 💪 courage and helmet🧢

* 🔵 First part is ok even for beginners
* 🔴 Second part is hard but you can "escape" when you are tired
* 🟢 Easy for goats

🧗‍♂️🔴⚔️ Rent your via ferrata set and join me after work to climb up to Bastille 🏰. I will teach you the basics and help you if you get stuck 💪. This via is split into 2 parts: the first part is easy but has a lot of vertigo 😵, while the second part is harder and requires more muscle 💪. But don’t worry, if you get tired, you can escape the via and climb easily to the top 🏔️. So come and join me for an adventure of a lifetime 🤩!

Please note that while I am not a professional climbing instructor 🧗‍♂️, I will be happy to show everyone how to properly wear their Via Ferrata sets 🪢 and provide assistance during the climb if needed 🆘. My goal is to ensure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience while exploring the beauty of the mountain ⛰️👀. 🧗‍♀️👍

## ⚠️ Rent your before the event ⚠️
Rent your Via Ferrata equipment (helmet 🪖, harness, and Via Ferrata set) before. You can do this at the “Adrenaline Sport” shop 🏬 near Parc Paul Mistral.
