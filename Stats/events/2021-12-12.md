# snowfunning (Episode 2)🛷☃️❄️⛰️

![2021-12-12](/Stats/img/orig/2021-12-12.jpg)

✓Update 11 Dec 2021 @11:00 AM : -Unfortunately, we still have no cars, so I updated the description for the plan B. Please read the description, especially the time schedule, again. We make the effort to get up earlier, but, hopefully, we will be rewarded with a beautiful sunrise on the mountains😉
-Make sure you will return the snowshoes to the shop if you are renting them.
-Note that we are taking the last bus for return. The previous bus leaves Chamrousse at 13h45. Theoretically, we can make it if we hurry, but lets makes it a relaxed hike and enjoy the powder day with a nice weather.

Seemingly, they have enough snowshoes for Sunday, so this shouldn't be a problem.
You can also rent them in Grenoble, from shops such as Adrenaline pro shop, skitruck, etc (In this case you need to get them on Saturday evening and return them back after the hike). You can book it in advance in their website also (For example, https://app.getlokki.com/SKITRUCK )
