##  🤓 Initiation to Via Ferrata 🤓 

I (Albin) am not a guide and i will not be responsible of you or your security. But I will teach you how to do Via Ferrata safely. I'm also used to do Via Ferrata with totally beginners, so I will ensure that you can complete the Via Ferrata safely.

For safety reason, I will limit the group to a maximum of 14 people including me.
