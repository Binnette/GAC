## 🥾 No car, no bus, just hike from Grenoble to Fort St Eynard
🔴 hard for beginners
🔵 medium-hard for good hikers

**What to expect:**
No technical difficulty but a sporty hike to reach the fort of Mont St-Eynard from Grenoble directly. We will take the bus back from Col de Vance or hike back (depending on 1. we feel our legs or not 😋 2. we kept a good pace to catch the bus at 17:24h, else we hike back 🤩).

Essentially,
**Bastille -> Mont Jalla -> almost Mont Rachais -> Col de Vance ->** **Mont St-Eynard fort -> Col de Vance -> (if tired or late)----> bus back to Grenoble**
**(else)** **\-\-\-\-\> hike back to Grenoble**

So, we will try to keep a good pace!

There is an individual option to take the bus back even before without going up to the Fort from Col de Vance if you don't feel like it (check bus details).

Distance: \~15km (\~20km if we hike back too)
Time: \~7h of hike + 3\*30 min breaks
Ascent+ : \~1365m 🔥
Descent- : \~800m
Max Elevation: 1350m
Min Elevation: 215m
