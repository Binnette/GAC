##  🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️ 
🦅/🐓 : we speak English/French in all our events. Don't be worry if your English/French is not that good. Nos évènements sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas "suffisant".

##  🥾 Hike: too hot on Sunday, go to lake "Bois Français" 🏊‍♀️🌞 
You will join the canoe team (https://www.meetup.com/Grenoble-Adventure-Club-English-French/events/280011169/) and hike with us until the lake "Bois Français". But instead of canoe, you can just chill at the lake. Then you will go back to Grenoble without me (I will canoe), but you can take the same way done during morning. Or you can maybe take a bus (you have to check) or hitch-hike.

Health pass is mandatory. Lake entrance cost 3.5€ per person.
The lake is open until 8pm.
