We will be taking the 6:58 am train to Chambéry (12,70 EUR).

Path A: https://www.altituderando.com/Traversee-de-la-Chartreuse-par-le-Mont-Granier-et-Dent-de-Crolles

Distance: 71 km
D: +3300/-3450m
The GPX track is available in the provided website.

It is forbidden to camp using a tent in the Natural Reserve of Chartreuse from July 1st to August 31st. So, if we take Path A, two options:

a) sleep in open air inside of the Reserve (no tent)
b) camp outside of the Reserve (days 1 and 2)

Path B: https://www.chartreuse-tourisme.com/a-voir-a-faire/marcher-courir-rouler/balades-randonnees/la-traversee-de-chartreuse/
Distance: 90km
D: +5036m/-4976m
The GPX track is available in the provided website.

Water-wise both paths have enough to carry on (see http://www.refuges.info/nav/2/massif/Chartreuse/).

Whichever the path, we will be walking around 10h per day.
