# Weekend Trail Planning (with apéritif)

![2020-07-02](../img/orig/2020-07-02.jpg)

Hello! This will be a recurring Meetup each week on Thursday evenings (location to very).

The objective of this meeting is to set a plan for the hikes that will occur that weekend (and to also get to know each other better or answer any questions newcomers might have).

Maybe you are an expert who can share some tips with others, or maybe you have never hiked before and are hesitant with questions. All are welcome to help plan the best hike each weekend!

Although it will not be needed to participate in these meetings to join us during the weekend, the itinerary for the weekend hike should be set by Thursday evening.

Hope to see you there!
