## 🥾 Take **Bus** to Col de Port and then hike to la Pinéa and then to Chalet du Charmant Som - WINTER EDITION 

🔴 medium-hard for beginners
🔵 easy-medium for good hikers
⚫ impossible if you can't wake up early on a Sunday :)

No Albin-level experience here! So tread carefully! :)

What to expect:

* Planned by bus but cars welcome
* We will go to the slender summit of the Pinéa (a beautiful 360 view on clear days) and then head to the chalets of Charmant Som (with a Fromagerie with amazing Tomme and fresh Yogurt at the base, and a wonderful view at the top).

This is written by Vaibhav, there will be no such thing as the chalet is closed in winter.

* No risk passages, except for the final steep climb to La Pinéa, most of the path is proper route. The track to Pinéa is covered by trees so expected to be icy-snow, and muddy as usual. Weather prediction is partially sunny on Sunday for now.

* Distance: 13km
* Time: \~5h of hike + 40min breaks + 1.5h bus back and forth
Elevation+ : \~600m
