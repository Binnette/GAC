Joining the event = Accepting the rules (See rule section below)

## ⭐⭐ Updates ⭐⭐

* 📅 Wednesday 20 July @ 11 am: we don't have any cars, so we will stick to plan B and go by bus. This means that we will do an easier hike before and after the bungee jumping (let's hope the buses work as they have scheduled!)

Hello GAC friends,
I am excited to be back in Grenoble for a week. I would be glad to meet you either during this adventure, after the event over a pizza/drink, or another day.

First of all, you can skip doing the bungee jumping and just join us for the hike and see us jump 😃
