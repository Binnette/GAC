## 🔦Speleology in Vercors: Grotte des Eymards (Eymards Cave) 🧗
Are you ready some new adventure? I just booked a initiation to speleology made by a professionnal guide. I never done this type of activity, so I post this event here in case you want to participate and discover the joy of underground climbing. 😉 I have a car so I can carpool 3 more people at the start which is in Lans en Vercors. On the website, there are still 9 people who can join (the guide can manage only a limited number of people). If you have a car let me know in the comment section (I will increase the number of participant up to 12)!

## ❔ How to participate and register? ❔
🛎️ ⚠️: Group is full!

## 🧗‍♂️ Details about the activity 🧗‍♂️
Speleology is climbing inside a cave. So it's underground 😅 (if you are claustrophobic, this is probably not for you). There will be some climbing, ramping and a 30m abseiling (rappel)... But be reassured, a professionnal guide will be there to assist you at any time if you haven't done it before (it's my case). So it will be only fun!! 😍

## =🚗 share=
Car share will cost 3€ per person (fuel + "compensation" to get more drivers). We will park our car(s) at the parking of the cave.

## ❔🧗‍♂️ What do you need for speleology ❔🧗‍♂️
✔️ A specific suit, a light and helmet will be given by the guide
- Sporty and warm clothes (it's between 10-15°C undeground so make sure to bring at least a "polaire")
- Sport shoes
- Water and small things to eat (energy bar type): 🍫 + 🧃

## After the event
If you feel like it, we can share a drink, a pizza or an ice cream depending on the mood of the crowd.

## 😷 Covid rules 😷
