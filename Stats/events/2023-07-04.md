##  🧗‍♂️🔴Via ferrata: La Bastille 🌄 A Challenging Climb with a View of Grenoble! 

* 🔵 First part is ok even for beginners
* 🔴 Second part is hard but you can "escape" when you are tired
* 🟢 Easy for goats

🧗‍♂️🔴 Grab your via ferrata gear and meet me after work for an exhilarating climb to Bastille 🌄. I will show you the way and assist you if you need help 💪. This via has two sections: the first one is easy but has a lot of exposure 😵, while the second one is more challenging and requires more strength 💪. But don’t worry, if you feel exhausted, you can exit the via and climb easily to the summit 🏔️. So come and join me for a thrilling experience 🤩!

Please note that while I am not a professional climbing instructor 🧗‍♂️, I will be happy to show everyone how to properly wear their Via Ferrata sets 🪢 and provide assistance during the climb if needed 🆘. My goal is to ensure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience while exploring the beauty of the mountain ⛰️👀. 🧗‍♀️👍
