# Chill afternoon Geocaching: from noob/muggle to legend

![2020-07-18](/Stats/img/orig/2020-07-18.jpg)

--FR/EN--

Let's do Geocaching for noobs!
## 
This session, we will seek some "mystery caches"... but for noobs. Before finding caches, we will need to solve some challenges/puzzle to get each cache coordinates : counting trees, summing elements on visuals and so on. I will bring some paper and pencils in order to solve each puzzle. If interested, you can download the app "c:geo" (Android only) to be able the solve those challenges.

About the group/A propos du groupe
## 
EN: Everybody is welcome to join the group, we can speak in French, English, etc.
FR: Tout le monde est bienvenu, nous pourrons disctuer en fran√ßais, anglais, etc.

About the trails
## =
We will start at Parc Paul Mistral near the "Vasque Olympique" at 15:30.
And we will end at the campus. Depending on time and our mood we can do other caches and go back to Grenoble center by walking, then grab a beer and some food.

About geocaching

Geocaching is a worldwide game, your goal is to find "cache" basically a box with a logbook inside and some other funny stuffs. When found, you will have to write our Geocaching username on it to be credited by game points.
