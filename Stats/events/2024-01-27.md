##  🥾🔵 Hike: Belvédère Château Julien from near Villard-de-Lans

* 🔵 Ok for regular hikers with slippery/ice-ready shoes
* 🔴 Some paths can be too steep for noobs with slippery mud/ice

We will do an afternoon+night hike in Vercors. I want to enjoy fullmoon during the night. So don't forget to bring warm tea/coffee, warm clothes and so on. Also don't forget to bring good non-slippery shoes as we may encounter icy paths. Also bringing hiking poles is a good idea to prevent sliding on ice. Since we will hike during the night, make sure to bring head lamp (or any lamp) and make sure you have charged your phone in case you want to use its flashlight to walk during the night.
Rough plan:
\- Start the hike at around 1 pm\.
\- Reach "Scialet de Malaterre" at around 3\-3:30 pm\.
