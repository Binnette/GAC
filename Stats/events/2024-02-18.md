##  🥾🔵 Hike: Snow walk in Vercors ⛄🛷, loop around Charande 🗻 

* 🔵 Medium for noobs. Some steep path with snow.
* 🟢 Easy for good hikers

🧦/🥾: We will hike in snow so take "water/snow" resistant warm shoes. You can also put a second pair of dry socks/shoes in the car trunk.

👋 Let’s have a fun hike in the snowy Vercors. 🏔 We will drive for an hour and park at “Les Aigaux”, a spot for hikers after Engins. 🚗 We will start our hike there and walk on a forest trail. 🌲 At the end of the trail, we will take a shortcut and climb a little to join the main hiking path on the ridge. ⛰ From there we will hike north on the mountain edge and see many beautiful views. 😍 We will go by Charande, the highest point of our hike at 1709m. 🙌 After Charande we will go south and down to the car. 🚗 On the way we will one alpine hut and check if it is open or locked. 🏠
