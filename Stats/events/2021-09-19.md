# Moderate Hike: Chamechaude (+Basic Technical Skills)

![2021-09-19](../img/orig/2021-09-19.jpg)

Moderate Hike with scrambling and use of a fixed chain. Good Fitness required.

Let's hike to the roof of the Chartreuse Massif.

If there is a shortage of cars, it is possible to take the bus to the start point. This would be an early start, leaving Notre Dame Musée at 8:10 (route 62). The next bus leaves too late at 10:00.

Trip may be limited in numbers for safety- leader:member ratio.
