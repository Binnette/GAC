##  🧗🔴 Via ferrata: 'Roche Veyrand' 😲 + 🏊‍♀️ in refreshing 🧊 river 💧 

* 🔵 medium for climbers
* 🔴 hard for noobs 🙃 + a lot of vertigo

Join me for this via ferrata in St-Pierre-d’Entremont, a beautiful village in the heart of the Chartreuse mountains 🏔. We will start with a 45-minute hike to approach the start of the via ferrata 🧗‍♂️. Enjoy this hard and breathtaking via ferrata that has a lot of vertigo 😱. After the via, we can reach the top of the mountain “Roche Veyrand”, where we can have a picnic 🥪. Then we will climb down the steep path to reach back to St-Pierre-d’Entremont. From here we can reach the nice bathing place in the village center, where we can cool off and have some fun in the water 💧. Note: the via ferrata is not mandatory, you can join just for the hike and wait for us at the top of the mountain.
