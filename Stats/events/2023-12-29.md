# GAC indoor activities: axe throwing

![2023-12-29](../img/orig/2023-12-29.jpg)

Hello everyone,

Tomorrow, I will go to an axe-throwing bar to awaken my inner viking 😁
It would be more enjoyable to do it together. Here is the location of the bar:

It is safer than it looks😉. You can come and see if you like it, and then decide to do it and pay on-site.

The plan is very simple, I have booked one "cible" for tomorrow Friday December 29 at 7 pm. You can reserve your place using the following link:

We can choose a place to eat dinner together afterwards 🥪🌮🍕😃
