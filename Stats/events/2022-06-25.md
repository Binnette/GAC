##  Summary 
A third (3rd) in a series of Hikes around Grenoble without Cars: Le Moucherotte -- One of the most commonly undertaken and iconic hikes in Grenoble.

We will endure hell and arrive on the "roof" for wonderful lunch picnic with a wonderful bi-directional panoramic view, both Grenoble (east) and the inner-Vercors (West)

The high point on The Vercors Mountain (west) seen from Grenoble.

If you live in Grenoble and look west at any point, you've seen waypoint from a distance.

##  🟠🟢 🥾 Difficulty / Skill 🟠🟢 🥾

This event will classify this as a "Medium-easy" hike, as the event is NOT TECHNICALLY CHALLENGING (it is a well-maintained and safe trail), but because of the duration of the event (distance of the route, in addition to elevation gain), and recent weather conditions (very hot), I want to be impress upon attendees the physical duress we will endure !

##  General Plan 

We will all take the Trans Isère bus [T65] from Grenoble Gare to the trailhead (Village Saint Nizier office de Tourism) .

Come early to buy tickets (or use SMS)
