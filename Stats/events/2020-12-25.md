![2020-12-25](../img/orig/2020-12-25.jpg)

Alone on Christmas away from your family? No need to mope and home! Come break a sweat and enjoy a few.

Weather 📝: I am tracking le météo . If it doesn’t clear by 09:00, we can postpone an hour, or reschedule for Saturday. There are still a few days left in 2020, and I’m not taking any unnecessary risks 😇.

The route is TBD. Several Options Below. We can decide as a group at departure time.

Start to think about what soup or tea with which you fill you Thermos!

Recommendations for Today:

- Thermal/Long Underwear Base Layer
- Water resistant top layers
- Gloves and Balaklava
- Food and Snacks for a 3 hour hike.
- Warmers (gloves/shirts)
