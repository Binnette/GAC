# [Cuves de Sassenage Cancelled] Let's do some via Ferrata instead!

![2020-07-19-via](../img/orig/2020-07-19-via.jpg)

Edit : our speleology adventure is cancelled by the company. We will do the "Via Ferrata de la Bastille" instead.

FR/EN : Like in all our events, we will speak in English and/or French. Don't be worry if you english is not that good. Tous nos évènements sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas bon.

Rent your equipment!
---------------
You need to rent your Via Ferrata equipment (casque+baudrier+longes).

For example, you can go to the shop "Adrénaline Sport" near the cinema "Pathé Chavant" (https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4367709826). You should try the equipment into the shop to see if it sweet you well.

You will be charge only for one day rent (10 or 15€), to do so you need to rent on Saturday between 18:00 & 19:00 (shop is closed on Sunday), then we will give back the equipment Sunday to "Domino's Pizza" at the corner (https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1324802814)

This event is free except the renting of Via Ferrata equipment.

What do you need
---------------
- Via Ferrata equipment : casque+baudrier+longes
- A good pair of shoes (hiking shoes are highly recommended otherwise you will slip on the rocks)
- Some water
- Some snack and some food if you want to lunch together

Initiation to Via Ferrata
---------------
I (Albin) am not a guide and i will not be responsible of you or your security. But I will teach you how to do Via Ferrata safely. I'm also used to do Via Ferrata with totally beginners, so I will ensure that you can complete the Via Ferrate safely.

BTW, there are 2 possibilities to "exit" the Via Ferrata if you are really tired.

For safety reason, I will limit the group to a maximum of 7 people including me.

About "Les prises de la Bastille"
---------------
This Via Ferrata have 2 parts:
- First part is really easy but very vertiginous and have no exit.
- Second part is hard but not vertiginous and have 2 exits.
