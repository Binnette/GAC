## 🥾🔵 Hike: Loop around St-Georges-de-Commiers and walk along old train path 🚂

* 🔵 Ok for regular hikers with mud ready shoes
* 🔴 Some path can be too steps for noobs with slippery mud

🚗 We park our cars near a church in St-Georges-de-Commiers. 🚶‍♂️ We start by hiking in fields and reach another church. 🧗‍♀️ Then we climb up and hike in the forest, passing by some viewpoints. 🌲 Then we go back down and walk in Notre-Dame-de-Commiers and visit another church. ⛪ Finally, we hike on a path along the old train line of Train de la Mure until we get back to our start point. 🚂
