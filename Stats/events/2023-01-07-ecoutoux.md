## =Summary

An nice easy (\*) hike enjoy the weekend and get some mild fitness.
From a series of "Easy Hikes Around Town Without Cars" GAC Events that I will be hosting this summer/autumn (Trains, Trams, Bus, Telepherique only!)

(\*) This is a technically easy trail, but because of the Winter season, the trail is likely slippery / muddy and can be a bit treacherous, thus, Batons (Hiking Poles) are obligatory. There is a beautiful place at top to take in some fresh air.

* [💧💧](https://emojipedia.org/droplet/)**IMPORTANT NOTE**[💧💧](https://emojipedia.org/droplet/): The public water fountains around Grenoble are out-of-service/hors-service since November due to sub-zero temperatures, so you absolutely must bring your own water (no chance to fill your bottle on arrival)
* [🕒🕒](https://emojipedia.org/three-oclock/)**IMPORTANT NOTE**[🕒🕒](https://emojipedia.org/three-oclock/): COME VERY EARLY TO FORM AN "ENGLISH QUEUE" (Defined as a straight and orderly line). The TAG bus #62 capacity crowded at time of the year many people are going up for ski .

## 🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️
🦅/🐓 : We speak English/French in all our events. Don't be worry if your English/French is not that good. Nos évènements sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas "suffisant".
