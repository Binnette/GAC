## 🥾🔴 **Hike to Lances de Malissard from le Col de Marcieu via the Aulp du Seuil**
🔴 medium-hard for good hikers
⚫ hardcore for beginners (not recommended)

No Albin-level experience here! So tread carefully! :)

**What to expect:**
No risk passages (proper predictable route) but overall 1180m (or 1540m for the peak) of elevation gain and certain steep sections, with 16 km total distance with later section mostly on snow. We will need to keep a good pace to finish on time. But of course, we will adapt and shorten the route if needed. More importantly, need to be equipped. Less equipment == More suffering. It's the 3rd highest peak in Chartreuse!

## ❔ **What do you need** ❔
\- Snowshoes OR snow\-boots with long gaiters \(individual choice for comfort\, no fresh snow\)
\- Crampons \(keep for comfort on icy sections\)
\- Hiking pole \(highly recommended\)
\- Winter gloves \(highly recommended\)
\- Neck warmer/Beanie/anything to cover ears \(recommended\)
\- Hiking shoes \(mandatory\)
\- Clothes for snow\, wind \(layer\-up\)
\- 🌞 Sun\-cream / 😎 Sun glasses
\- 🧃 Water \+ 🍫 Some snack \+ Food
\- 💵 Money for car share \(exact change in cash\)
\- Your smile and happiness 😁

Rent whatever you need from "La Randonnee" or "Espace Montagne" or "LeBonCoin" or just google around to find the best deal!
