##  🥾🔵 Hike: Still some ⛄️ snow at 🛖 Cabane de Combe Oursière? 🤔 

* 🔵 Steepness go crescendo until the top, maybe some snow there.

Embark on a journey to uncover a quaint little cabin nestled in the mountains at the trail’s conclusion 🏔️. Curious if the winter’s blanket of snow still lingers ❄️? We’ll venture by car for an hour to “Moulin Vieux,” just beyond “La Morte.” Upon arrival, a brief visit to the village church is in order ⛪, followed by the commencement of our trek across the village’s welcoming flat fields 🌄. We might opt for a shortcut, but either way, our path leads us into the embrace of the forest 🌲, ascending 766m until we emerge to greet the alpine refuge: Cabane de Combe Oursière 🏠. Here, we’ll explore the cozy hut and likely pause for a lunch break 🍞. After a leisurely time near the hut, we’ll descend, diverging from our morning route to complete a circuit back to our starting point. Our return will be graced by the gentle company of a small stream, Ruisseau de Vaunoire, whispering alongside us 🚶‍♂️💦. And at last, we’ll find ourselves back at the parking lot, marking the end of our sojourn 🚗.
