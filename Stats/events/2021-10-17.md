⏪

A short hike along a ski trail (without snow of course), probably with a good view at the top! + card game depending on how many we are

Two points about this event:
1. You can skip the zipline and simply descend by walking.
2. Ziplining is limited to one person every 10 minutes, so reserve your spot😉

The trail is straightforward, I just see some dug channels along the way which probably we can avoid.

The ending time of the event depends on the number of hikers willing to do the ziplining. At most, we can be 13 people doing the zipline, which makes others wait for 2 hours. If this would be the case, we can play games and/or just chill in the town until everybody is back.
