##  Summary 

I scouted a new way to the Bastille via neighborhood La Tronche. It is a relatively affluent area with its own private entrance into The Bastille, and makes for a interesting area to explore the back streets of a cool and quirky new neighborhood.

##  Details 

It is an easy-to-difficult grade hike, mixed urban and trail, with a relatively steep incline, and it promises to help you break a sweat.
