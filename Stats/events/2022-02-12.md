💡 Read the full page by clicking on "Read more"/"Lire la suite"...💜
Joining the event = Accepting the rules (See rule section below)

👀 Note I will limit the group to 10/12. I can not deal with a bigger group of NOOBs. Also I am not a ski teacher, but I will try to help you.

💡 Let me know in the comment, if you are not a noob. Then you will help me to coach the noobs.

##  ⭐⭐ Updates ⭐⭐ 
- 📅 Feb 11 - 4pm: more cars = more seats. Seats: Albin (4), Djilali (4), Tania (4)
- 📅 Feb 11 - 4pm: we are full 12 noobs skier is more than enough for me 😇 Anyway feel free to register in waiting list if some people unsubscribe. Otherwise see you in a next event (hike or ski)

##  🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️ 
🦅/🐓 : we speak English/French in all our events. Don't worry if your English/French is not that good. Nos évènements sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas "suffisant".

##  🎿 Ski: Ski for NOOB - Session 3 ⛷ 
Ski training for noob/beginner ONLY. We will stay together during the whole day.

✅ If you are a good skier, you can join but you will stay with the group and help NOOBs to learn how to ski. This event is not about having a ride to a ski station and ski alone. You will stay in the group and help noobs.

🟨 DO NOT BRING YOUR SKI (unless you have your own car) cause there is not enough place in my car. We will rent ski directly at the station.

Meet at 8:15am at parking "Esplanade du Souvenir Français" near Parc Paul Mistral:

We ride our cars for about 45m. Then park our car(s) directly at the ski station :

##  🎿 Ski renting🎿 
We will go to the shop "AB Sport" to rent ski directly at ski station. It will take time if we are a big group so be patient. The shop is open 9am-12:30pm and 1pm-5pm. So we will stop ski near 4:30pm to bring the ski to the shop.

Renting Ski + Ski shoes + pole + helmet = 20€50 (Detail here: https://s.42l.fr/-7o3JT-y)

##  💲 Ski Pass 💲 
To enter the ski station, you need a ski pass. Two options:
- 13€80 Only the beginner part of the station (we will take this option)
- 21€ Full station

This is not my idea... but if you are happy with your "ski teacher" you can help him/her pay his/her ski pass 😇💙

##  🚗 share 
Car share will cost 5€ per person (fuel + "compensation" to get more drivers). 😷 You have to wear a mask in car.
