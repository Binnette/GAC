## 💥💥 WARNING 💥💥
YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO SWIM

🔴⚫ We will hike on regular path from Quaix to Sarcenas. Have launch in Sarcenas.

💦 Then we literally jump in the river with everything (clothes, phone, shoes, wallet, etc). And we "hike" down inside the river to go back to Quaix. Be sure that you will be completely wet.

💧 Everything you bring will be wet. If you have waterproof bag TAKE IT, otherwise DO NOT TAKE your phone, wallet, etc. They will just die in the river! If you really want to take your phone put it in 1 or even 2 zip bags. But I am not responsible if you break your phone by jumping or because of water 😅

💢 We will encounter many obstacles: waterfall, spiky bush, stinging bush, big trees fallen in river, sharp rocks, etc.

👞 You will keep your shoes all the way to walk in the river on the sharp rocks. Be careful, this "hike" is for "experts" only.

💥 Once we started to hike in the river there is no escape until the hand of the hike.

🔴 Hopefully we can do the hike in the river. But It may be possible that we will be stuck at some point and go back to find another path.

⚫ Please only join this "hike" is you are aware of the potential dangers and the needed equipment.
