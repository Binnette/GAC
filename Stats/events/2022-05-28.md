## 🥾🟢 Plan: Hike (Easy): Cascades (Waterfalls) at Canyon du Furon (village Sassenage)

The first in a series of "Easy Hikes Around Town Without Cars" GAC Events I'll be hosting this summer.

We'll be following a beautiful trail that shadows "Le Furon", named for it's stunning beauty and potential ferocity, a series of cascades that descend from the heart of the Vercor Mountains down into the village of Sassenage (just north-west of Grenoble).

Near the cascades, temperatures are normally 5degC cooler than in the city, so this is an exceptionally good place to visit in the summer to beat the heat.

NOTE: We will only hike; we WILL NOT be visiting the actual "Grotte Les Cuves de Sassenage" exhibit (A super cool place, literally, plus Science! Perhaps at a future Hybrid/Crossover event between the GAC / Museum Circuit).

BONUS: Local HISTORY ( MUSEUM Meetup ): As a special treat for those of you who also attend my Museum events, and who have come to the Museum of the Resistance and Deportation, we'll make an extra special trip to visit a memorial dedicated to the Maquis resistance of the Vercors.

If you're new to the Grenoble Adventure Club, and you've already hiked up the Bastille, and you're considering hiking more-challenging events with the GAC, this is an excellent opportunity to test your fitness, familiarize / sample the local geography, and test your gear (Break in your new boots)
