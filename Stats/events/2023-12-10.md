## 🥾🟢 Hike: Easy loop near Laffrey and its lakes 🌅🌲🌄🐌

* 🟢 : Too easy, ask your grandma to join.

How about some sunshine in Laffrey this Sunday? 🌞 We’ll drive for 40 minutes and park in Laffrey. We will start our hike straight in plains and forest. 🌲 We'll pass by the dam of Lac Mort. 🌊 From there we’ll hike on the road until we get to the hamlet “Le Sappey”. There we’ll admire the view from an old church. ⛪ Then we’ll begin our real ascent. We’ll stop at the Belvédère du Fond des Sciaux. 🌄 Then we’ll climb to the top named Canier (1221m) and enjoy some view on the way down. 🏔 Then we’ll descend to Cholonge. Then we'll walk around the lake of Laffrey. 🌳 And finally return to our cars. 🚗
