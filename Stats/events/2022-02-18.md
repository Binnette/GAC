## ⭐⭐ Updates ⭐⭐

* This event is a copy/paste of Hassan event. Hassan event starts at 4:30pm and my event starts at 5:30pm. And I will hike and not run. We will miss the sunset, but I can not leave office earlier.
* If you want to start at 4:30pm subscribe in Hassan event: https://www.meetup.com/Grenoble-Adventure-Club-English-French/events/284041009
* New difficulty levels from easy to hard : 🟢🔵🔴⚫

## 🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️
🦅/🐓 : we speak English/French in all our events. Don't worry if your English/French is not that good. Nos évènements sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas "suffisant".
