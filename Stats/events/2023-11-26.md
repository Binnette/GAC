##  🥾🟢 Hike: Easy loop around Theys 🍂🏡🍁 

* 🟢/🔵 Beginners welcome, no difficulty.
* 😎 Too easy for good hikers.

We’re off for a chill hike 🥾. We even have time to sleep in 😴 on this beautiful Sunday ☀️, a perfect opportunity to picnic 🧺 in the sun 🌞 while looking at the snowy mountains 🏔️. After a short half hour drive 🚗, we’ll park in the center of Theys Village 🏘️. From there, we’ll start our little loop 🔄 by gaining some altitude 📈, which should give us a nice view 🌄 of the village and the surroundings. We’ll continue our climb 🧗‍♂️ until a large meadow 🌳 where I hope we’ll have a pleasant view 🌼 for our snack break 🍞. After that, we’ll tackle the last ascent 🚵‍♀️ of the day to be able to join the way back to Theys 🛣️. We’ll go through different hamlets and woods 🌲 on our way.
