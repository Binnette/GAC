##  🥾⛺🔴 Hike Camp: after-work car ride + 🌠 night in tent + lake hike #Valsenestre 
We take cars after-work and ride to Valsenestre. We hike with headlamp for \~20mn with our tents and reach the bivouac place. There we eat/cook food, enjoy some shooting stars and sleep in our tents. The second day, we get back to the cars, drop our tents and start our day hike with our picnic and water. When we are done, we go back to Grenoble (before traffic jam?).

##  Day 1 
We ride our cars for \~1h30 and park at "Valsenestre":
