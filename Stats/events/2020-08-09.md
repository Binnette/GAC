Updates August 8th (12 am) :
-----> We didn't notice there is an extra fee for the entrance to the nautical base. They charge a few euros (from 2.5 to 3.5 â‚¬) depending the statuts (student, family, merely adult ... ). And may benefit from a set price to 2.5 if a bunch of 10 tickets is bought.
-----> For the canoe rental, please be aware to bring 25 â‚¬ CASH, NO CREDIT CARD !!!!
-----> There as still 2 more seats available if some of you or your friends are interested !!!!

Update: More seats are now sure to be available! The company has agreed to provide more than 8 places, but the count is not for sure yet. Join the wait list today and we will keep you informed!

*******

Next weekend letâ€™s plan to do some hiking, swimming, and canoeing for 20km on the Isere! Adventure style! 7 seats are open and no more will become available!

Plan is as follows for Sunday August 9th:

9h - Depart central ville for 3 hour (flat hike/walk/trÃ¨s simple) via Chemin des Agricultures to Bois franÃ§ais.

Noon/Midi â€“ Arrive at Bois franÃ§ais to eat lunch and do some swimming at the lake there (not in the Isere!). Get cool from this heat!

13h30 â€“ Get prepared to get in canoes and to meet the canoe company

14h â€“ Get in the canoes and head onto the Isere towards Pont Oxford

18h â€“ Arrive to Pont Oxford

18h30 â€“ Take Tram B back to city center

19h - ?
