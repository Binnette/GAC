# Weekend Trail Planning + Game

![2020-07-08](../img/orig/2020-07-08.jpg)

Hey Guys! Let's plan to discuss this weekends hike, play a cool game, and meet new people!

We will plan to meet at the Gare de Grenoble. This is where the game will begin.

For those of you who joined in yesterdays game, it is similair but instead of focusing on Street Art, this game will focus on all the handicap advancements the city of Grenoble has made. And I can already tell you that we will need to translate braille again like yesterday :)

For those of you who did not join us yesterday, the game will be a suprise for you ;)

So bring a charged smart phone if you have one, and if not do not worry we always work in teams!

So don't be shy! Come for the fun, the game, to meet people, and to discuss this weekends hike!

Ã€ mercredi !
