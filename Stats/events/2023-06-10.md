* 🔵 Medium for beginners
* 🟢 Easy for good goat climbers

I’m organizing a Via Ferrata event 🥾 in La Morte and would love for you to join me. We’ll park in the village 🚗 and then head to the river where we’ll equip our Via Ferrata sets 🧗‍♀️ and begin our ascent up the mountain ⛰️. Once we reach the top, we’ll have a picnic 🧺🍎🥪 and enjoy the view 🌄.

Afterward, we’ll head back down to La Morte where we’ll have the option to either try a second Via Ferrata route if we have enough time and motivation 💪 or simply relax by the river 💦 or lake 🏊‍♀️.

Please note that while I am not a professional climbing instructor 🧗‍♂️, I will be happy to show everyone how to properly wear their Via Ferrata sets 🪢 and provide assistance during the climb if needed 🆘. My goal is to ensure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience while exploring the beauty of the mountain ⛰️👀. 🧗‍♀️👍
