##  ⭐⭐ Updates ⭐⭐ 

> 📅 September 24: 1 car: Phillipe (3 seats)

> 📅 September 23: Bus it is. Musee Notre Dame, 07:50h meeting time so that you reach by 08:00h. The bus departs at 08:10h so please do not be late. In case someone with a car joins, people who subscribed earlier/who live farther/who-really-want-to-hike-but-not-take-bus will get the seats^^

> 📅 September 22: no cars: for the time being the plan is to take the bus. So essentially everyone on the waiting list motivated to hike is in. I hope we get some cars and then we can start from Park Paul Mistral car park as usual.

> Since "is it a difficult hike?" is a relative question, see the image to assess the difficulty for yourself ^^

Feel free to join the waitlist until we get more drivers!

## Too Long Didn't read
> Transportation: If no drivers, we will take bus 62 from Musee Notre Dame strictly at 08:10 h (the next bus would be at 10:00 h)

> Weather: Looks clear the whole afternoon (15-20 degrees), some shower at 18h.
> Difficulty: See the image and gauge for yourself. Overall the track is muddy at some points but the elevation gain is okay.
