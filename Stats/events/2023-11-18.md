##  🥾🔵 Hike: From Vif to Le Pieu ⛰ 1270m 🍃🍁🍂 

* 🔵/🔴 A bit steep for beginners.
* 🟢 Easy for good hikers.

🚗 We will drive our cars for 20 minutes and park near the entrance of Vif city center. 🚗 🥾 From there we will start our hike and probably take a short break at the hunter relay. 🥾 🌄 Then we will continue our adventure until we reach the top of our journey at the peak named “Le Pieu” 1270m. 🌄 👀 It’s not a very high peak but we should have some views over Grenoble, Vercors and Belledonne. 👀 🍽️ After our lunch break, we will descend the mountain until we reach the path that we left in the morning. 🍽️ 🔄 From there we will make a loop back to Vif. 🔄 🎢 We will hike on a long straight path that is shaped like a rollercoaster, up, down, up, down, … 🎢 🚗 Finally, we will get back to our cars and drive back to Grenoble. 🚗
