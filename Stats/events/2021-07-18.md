## 🌊Canyoning in Vercors : Les Ecouges 🧗
Lets go canyoning in Vercors! For those who don't know what canyoning is, it's basically advancing in a river usually inside a canyon by all means 😀 This includes: jumping in water (saut), sliding (toboggans) and abseiling (descente en rappel),... So you need to know how to swim to participate! If you have never done it in the past, no biggies ! there will be a professionnal guide with us all the time making sure that we stay alive. So it will be only fun!! 😍

## ❔ How to participate and register? ❔
We can be maximum 9 people (3 cars to do the activities). For now I can bring 4 people (including me) with my car. So we need another car. So, join the list (or the waiting list) and once we have the correct number I will book for the group. Cost should be between 60-65€ depending if we are enough or not for 4h30 of activities with Vertical Aventure.
