## 🥾🟢 Plan: Hike (Easy): Cascades (Waterfalls) at Canyon du Furon (village Sassenage)

A continuation in a series of "Easy Hikes Around Town Without Cars" GAC Events I'll be hosting this summer.

We'll be following a beautiful trail that shadows "Le Furon", named for it's stunning beauty and potential ferocity, a series of cascades that descend from the heart of the Vercor Mountains down into the village of Sassenage (just north-west of Grenoble).

Near the cascades, temperatures are normally 5degC cooler than in the city HyperCenter, so this is an exceptionally good place/location to visit during the "dog days of summer" in Grenoble to beat the heat.

NOTE: We will only hike; we WILL NOT be visiting the actual "Grotte Les Cuves de Sassenage" exhibit .

BONUS: Local HISTORY: For those of you who also attend my Museum events, and who have come to the Museum of the Resistance and Deportation, we'll make an extra special trip to visit a WW2 memorial dedicated to the Maquis resistance of the Vercors.

If you're new to the Grenoble Adventure Club, and you've already hiked up the Bastille, and you're considering hiking more-challenging events with the GAC, this is an excellent opportunity to test your fitness, familiarize / sample the local geography, and test your gear (Break in your new boots)
