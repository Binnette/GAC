## An evening at Paladru lake : chill out, swim, canoeing…
You can bring whatever you want : books, beach games, swimsuit, plaids, something to eat, something to drink…
There can be mosquitoes so don't forget to bring protection: lotion, long clothes...
For the ones who would like to canoe :
I’ve got an inflatable stand up paddle but it will be too late to rent one so you will be able to canoe with me only if you bring your own.
