##  Day 1 
We’ll start with a 2-hour car ride 🚗 to La Cluse. Our first hike begins with light bags 🎒, carrying only picnic 🥪 and water 💧. We’ll traverse through forest 🌳 and grasslands 🌿, reaching the mineral-rich landscape of “Col de Plate Contier” 🪨. Our goal is the peak of “Tête de Garnesier” ⛰️. After our descent, we’ll drive for \~30m to our night camp 🏕️ and set up our tents by throwing them from the car trunk (head lamps on).

##  Day 2 
After a pleasant breakfast, we’ll pack up our tents and prepare our light bags 🎒. Our first task is to climb to the highest point of our hike, Pic de Bure at 2709m ⛰️. Once we’ve taken in the view, we’ll continue our hike on the “Plateau de Bure”, walking alongside the large satellite antennas of the observatory 📡. Who knows, maybe some of us will hear an alien 👽? From there, we’ll complete our loop hike all the way down to the cars 🚗. Finally, we’ll embark on our 2-hour car ride back to Grenoble.
