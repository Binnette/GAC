##  🥾🔴 Hike: Vertical Kilometer to Grand Serre 🥵🤯 + Small AquaHike 🐸 + Lake 🌊 

* ⚫️ Not for beginners
* 🔵/🔴 Medium/hard for good hikers

We will park the cars 🚗 near the lake, so please leave any unnecessary items in the cars. Remember to bring a picnic+water 🥪 and consider bringing a bathing suit 👙 and water shoes if you want to participate in the aqua hike at the end of the hike.

Afterward, we’ll head to the village of Cholonge 🏘️ and begin our hike to the top ⛰️. The hike has an elevation gain of 1000 meters over 2 km, with a slope of 50% !!! So please only join if you are a confident hiker 🥵

Once we reach the top, we’ll have a picnic 🍎🥪 and enjoy the view 🌄. Then we’ll head back down to Cholonge and have the opportunity to participate in the aqua hike. The aqua hike involves walking in the river bed with your feet in the water 💦. Finally, we’ll return to the lake 🏊‍♀️ where we can relax, swim, and play games 🎾🏓.
