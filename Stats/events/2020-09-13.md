# Dré dan l'pentu / Straigth to the top -- 🥾+🏊

![2020-09-13](/Stats/img/orig/2020-09-13.jpg)

⚠️ Update 10/09/20 10pm: It's a joined event with the hike "Around lac de Laffrey", we will meet the rest of the group at the beach.
______________________
The GAC is also about finding new challenge, so here is one: A vertical kilometer! Le GAC c'est aussi fait pour trouver de nouveaux objectifs, donc en voici un: Un kilomètre vertical!
An alternative itinerary around "Lac de Laffrey" is also proposed for a 2nd group looking for a lower level of challenge. Details here: https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Grenoble-Adventure-Club-English-French/events/273156179/

## 🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️
🦅/🐓 : we speak English/French in all our events. Don't be worry if your english/french is not that good. Nos events sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas "suffisant".

This hike will join the other hike of the day at "Plage de la Bergogne" for a swim to relax after so much effort 😀. We will drive to chollonge by car!

---Itinerary --- : 💪💪💪
🥾: We will go on the vertical kilometer in Chollonge. As it can be understood it's a steep and DIFFICULT hike. Indeed, we are going straight to the top so portion of the path are at 45° sometimes! Be sure you gonna sweat with this one! 😅 Hiking shoes are MANDATORY for this itinerary and hiking poles highly recommended.
- Duration: 6h30
- Distance: 11.5km
- Slope (Denivelé): + 1270m/-1270m

## 📅
Rough schedule:

___🚗_🚗____
We will carpool to reach Chollonge because there is no easy public transportation. Cost is 5€/person to give to the driver. I (Julien) take my car and can bring 3 more people with me. If you have a car please let me know (send me message or put a comment) and I will increase little by little the number of participant. It will be limited to 15 people overall.

For planning reason, please indicate when you register if you have a car.

Don't hesitate if you have questions (in french or english).
N'hésitez pas si vous avez des questions.
