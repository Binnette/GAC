Tomorrow the weather is quite bad... But let's not get that affect our mood. 😁 I suggest to do an escape game tomorrow afternoon at 2pm or 4pm. If you are an english speaker, please go nearly to the end and reach me if you want to organize something 😉

## ⭐⭐ Updates ⭐⭐
> 13.07 6.30pm: event is full

## =An escape...What??=
For those who don't know what an escape room is: it's a game where a team (including you) is locked down during 1h maximum in a room. The objective is to go out of this room by solving enigmas and succeding as a team in small tasks. May Sherlock wits be with us! 🧐

## ⚠️ 🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️⚠️
🦅: we speak English/French in all our events and normally your level doesn't matter. However, for this specific event language is important as you should be able to read and understand French to advance and understand the game 😉.
🐓 : Nous parlons français et anglais dans tous nos évènements et en général le niveau n'a pas trop d'importance. Cependant, pour ce cas spécifique, votre niveau est important car vous devez être en mesure de lire et comprendre le Français pour avancer et comprendre le jeu 😉.

## 🧐 What's the plan, Watson? 🧐
The 1st step is to gather a group of 5 people. I suggest we go to this escape room: https://www.challengetheroom.fr/challenge-the-room-grenoble-notre-dame.html. When we are enough, we will all decide which enigma we do as there are several options ☺️. I will do the booking. Tomorrow we meet next to the fountaine place Grenette and we will all go together at the escape room.

## 💡 Rules 💡
- Don't be late, we have to respect the timing of the company 😇
- Since places are limited, please do not subscribe if you are not sure to join the event ☺️

## ❔ What do you need for an escape game ❔
- Not much actually, come as you are... Or if you are crazy enough (and I like that) bring a costume respecting the theme of the escape game 🤣
- Cost will be between 30 and 22€ depending on our number, so bring some money 💲
- Your smile 😁 / Happiness 😊
- Your mask as always 😷 (avoid contact and so on)
- Your brain (we will need it) 🧠

## After the event
If you feel like it, we can share a drink, a pizza or an ice cream depending on the mood of the crowd.

## 😷 Covid rules 😷
- Don't come if you feel sick, have fever, are contact case,...
- As always, wear your mask (we will not wear the mask during the activity 😉)
- You are responsible of your own health, so respect barrier gestures, social distancing, ...
- All rules: https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/coronavirus-covid-19

--------------------------------
If you don't speak French, reach me as we can launch a 2nd group for english speaker as https://www.live-escape.net/book/ as some english speaking escape room and YOU will be the organizer! 😉 And we can all meet after our respective game!

If you have any questions, please let me know!
Si vous avez des questions, faites moi signe!

A demain!
Julien for the GAC.
