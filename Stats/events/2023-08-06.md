##  🥾🔴 Hike: Long 🥵 rewarding hike to 🏊‍♀️ in Lac du Vallon 🧊 

* ⚫ Not for beginners
* 🔵/🔴 Medium/Hard for good hikers. Very steep hike ↗⬆

We will meet at the parking lot 🅿️ at the end of the track, or as close as we can get by car 🚗. If the track is not accessible, we will have to hike a bit more, but it will be worth it 😍. The hike will start from the parking lot and follow the "Malsanne" river upstream ⬆️. Along the way, we will see some tiny huts 🏠 used by the sheepkeepers 🐑, and some waterfalls 💦. Our destination is the Lac du Vallon, a stunning lake 🏞 surrounded by mountains ⛰. There, we will have our picnic, take a nap 😴, and maybe even swim 🏊‍♂️🏊‍♀️ in the refreshing water 💧. After that, we will head back to the parking lot by almost the same route 😎.
