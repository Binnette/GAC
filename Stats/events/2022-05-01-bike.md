# 🚴 🏊‍♀️ Group Velo Ride: Lake Paladru (Lac de Paladru) 50km

![2022-05-01-bike](../img/orig/2022-05-01-bike.jpg)

(Event Under Development; it will be updated during Friday and Saturday)

A substitute event for those that were originally RSVP'd to ride to Vizille and still want to ride on Sunday 1st may:

* This will be a 50km ride way (instead of a 20km ride to Vizille)
* This ride will include a 600+ meter climb (as opposed to 0m elevation change To Vizille; for Comparison, a ride to Col de Port would be \~1000m climb/elevation gain)

So this will be for a bit more-experienced cyclists, or those that wish to become so (no one will be left behind)

##  Agenda (DRAFT) 

* 08:30-09:00: Queue at Gare Grenoble, Coffee ☕️
* 09:00-11:45: Ride to Paladru, stopping as needed.
* 11:45-13:00: Picnic / Swimming (negotiable based on air and water temperature)
* 13:00-15h+: Ride [back] to Grenoble

(We may stop for Fuel ☕️🫒🧀 🥐 at some point)

##  🚴‍♀️ Route 🚴

https://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/4971648034/

(I'm unfamiliar with the route, so please ensure your cell phones are 100% charged)

##  Beaches 
🏊 🤔🏊‍♀️🤔
I understand that Lake Paladru is private property, but there are municipal beaches that should be open to the public. We may need to encircle the lake en Velo to find a good spot. Please bring a few euros in case they're charging an entrance fee.

##  Note 📝 

I'm looking for riders/persons more-familiar with Lake Paladru, as I've never ridden there myself, so I'm unfamiliar with the best beaches/spots for swimming/picnic. I understand some of them are private….

##  What to Bring 

\* Water, 2L minimum (there should be fountains along the way; we'll make note of them for future events)
\* Snacks (Proteins and Complex Carbohydrates)
\* ID Wallet etc. 💰 💵 💷
\* Cash/Cards
\* Any medications you have
\* Bicycle Safety: Gloves/Gants, Lunettes/Eye Protection. Casque/Helmet
\* Flat tire/tyre spare repair kit (Pump, Tube, tools)
\* Towel 👙
\* Sunscreen/Creme de Solaire 🌞
\* Chapeau / Hat 🌞
