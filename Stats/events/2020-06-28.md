# Circuit Mont Jalla – Mont Rachais

![2020-06-28](../img/orig/2020-06-28.jpg)

Very Short notice! So we will keep planning simple. I propose to you the following for tomorrow.

What: Hike Circuit Mont Jalla – Mont Rachais

Where: We will meet at the Fontaine du Lion et du Serpent (105 Rue Saint-Laurent) we can start with a coffee and croissant + introduction before starting to ascend (We will begin this hike from the Bastille directly)

When: Sunday June 28 @ 9am – 5pm (?) I will be at the café that adjoins the fountain at 9am with my coffee waiting for others (wearing a blue shirt and I have blond hair - send me a message if you do not see me).

We will then plan to leave the cafe and begin the hike around 9:30am. Normally this route including the Bastille (ascend & descend) is planned @ 5.5 hours but I prefer to take several breaks along the way to make the hike as comfortable as possible for everyone and to enjoy the scenery. We should also plan a good amount of time to stop and have snack breaks plus a longer lunch break.

I also suggest returning to our point of the departure after the hike to have a soft drink or beer for those who would like (and discuss planning the next hike together!)
