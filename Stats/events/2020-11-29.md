# Carpe Diem! Make your own adventure

![2020-11-29](/Stats/img/orig/2020-11-29.jpg)

With the changes by French national government to our confinement, you are now able to travel for exercise up to 20km for 3 hours, daily.

Unfortunately, it must be a solo (or household) activity, but that presents lots of opportunities:

- Research a new hiking or cycling chemin/sentier !
- Get in shape for coming winter GAC adventures !
- Visit the Magasin de Sport and stock up on supplies!
- Work on your Winter tan?
- Goad a friend for a exercise PR!
- Chase a Dragon.

Two more weeks and then hopefully we're cut loose!

Let the absurd comments begin....
