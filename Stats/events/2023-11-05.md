🏔️ Join me for a hike to Pic Saint-Michel, a beautiful peak near Grenoble. We will start from the ski station and hike along the mountain ridge. On the way, we will see the “Trou Saint-Michel”, a deep hole that some of us might want to explore. We will also visit the “Vertige des Cimes”, a metal grid platform that gives a thrilling view of the valley below (not recommended for those who are afraid of heights). At the top of Pic Saint-Michel, we will enjoy the panorama if the sky is clear. Then we will slide down to the ski station. 🛷
Don’t forget to wear warm hiking shoes and why not put plastic bags inside to keep your feet dry. It will be cold! ❄️
