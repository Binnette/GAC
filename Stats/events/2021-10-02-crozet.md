Let's do a moderate hike to the Lake Crozet in Belledonne.

The Lake Crozet is famous for the "overflow" view that its dam gives to the Chartreuse Massif.
And besides its spectacular perspective, we will pass by a nice variety of land to get to the Lake: forest, waterfalls, rocky blocks, which largely participate in the general interest of this hike.
