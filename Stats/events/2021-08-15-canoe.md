##  About canoeing 
I've done exactly the same event 1 year ago. And in my opinion, it is open for beginners. There is no "extreme" difficulty. You will have to row your boat with another people. No need to have a lot of muscles, cause the river will push you gently until the end of the 20km.

❗❗ It's MANDATORY to know how to swim. At least 25 meters with your head temporary under the water. See https://canoe-grenoble.com/infos-pratiques/ (READ IT)

Note that we won't have any shadow during the whole afternoon. So take sun-cream/sunglasses/water/etc. Wearing shoes and a long short will prevent you to get burned by the sun.
