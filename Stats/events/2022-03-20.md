##  🥾🔵 Hike: Autour du Cirque de Saint-Même 
🔵 medium for good hikers
🔴 hard for beginners 🙃

The slope is quite intense and the path can be vertiginous at some points. Weather prediction is good for now.
VERY IMPORTANT: There is a delicate section Pas de la Mort. We will assess it to not be icy. We will not do the long loop if that section is icy. We will not do the long loop in case of fog and rain also since the trail can be slippery and dangerous. In this, case we will just take a tour of the waterfall which is nice too, refresh with a picnic and come back.

Meet at 9:30am at parking "Esplanade du Souvenir Français" near Parc Paul Mistral:
