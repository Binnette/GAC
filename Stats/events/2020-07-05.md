# "City Hike" with Game :)

![2020-07-05](../img/orig/2020-07-05.jpg)

Grenoble Street Art Escape Game!

Not a lot of d√©tails to give on this one.

The only things to plan on are wearing a comfortable pair of walking shoes and to have a lot of fun!

We will get organized before the games begin and perhaps try and find a way to relax after.

You can find more info in the link below.
