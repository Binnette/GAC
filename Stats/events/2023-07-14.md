## 🧗‍♂️🔴 Via-Ferrata: 🥾 then 🏊‍♀️ in Lacs Robert 🥶 and finally 2x🧗‍♂️
Beginners are welcome. There are 2 via ferrata. The second is not mandatory. The via are not very difficult, but we will hike until the Robert lakes, so beginners will probably already be tired before starting the Via. But we will probably lunch break at the lake before starting the via.

Do you love hiking, climbing, and swimming in the mountains? If yes, then this hike is for you! Join me for an adventure in Chamrousse. We will start from Le Recoin 🎿, and hike to Lac des Pourettes 🌲, a peaceful lake/swamp in the forest. From there, we will hike to Lacs Roberts 💙, three gorgeous alpine lakes with crystal clear water. Here we will swim in the cold water ❄️ (if you are brave enough!) and have lunch. Then we will do the first via ferrata 🧗‍♂️ On top, we will cross the brand new Himalayan bridge 🌉, a 130-meter-long walkway that hangs over the valley. If you want, you can do the second via ferrata or chill at the Cross of Chamrousse ✝️, a monument that stands at the highest point of the ski area. Then we will hike back to Le Recoin 🌅, enjoying some drinks and the fresh air before going back to Grenoble 🚗.
