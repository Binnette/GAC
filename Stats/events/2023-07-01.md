##  🧗🔵 Via ferrata: Rocher de l'envers 🏞️ + Cold stream 🥶🐠 (and lake?) 

* 🔵/🔴 Medium/hard for beginners
* 🟢 Easy for good goat climbers

🚗 Join us for an exciting adventure to St-Vincent de Mercuze! 🏞️ We’ll start with a top-level muddy and slippery hike (good shoes highly recommended) and pass some beautiful waterfalls 💦. Then, we’ll tackle the via ferrata 🧗‍♀️. Afterward, we’ll head back to the waterfall for a refreshing cold bath 🏊‍♂️. From there, we have two options: either stay and chill in the cold stream or head to the Plan d’eau des Lônes, a free lake that seems nice 🏖️. Finally, we’ll ride our cars back to Grenoble 🚗.

Just a heads up, the via ferrata is optional. 🧗‍♀️🧗‍♂️ If you’d rather skip it, you can meet us at the end of the route 📍 or hang out by the waterfall and chill 🌊💦 We’ll be back there after the via ferrata! 😎👍

Please note that while I am not a professional climbing instructor 🧗‍♂️, I will be happy to show everyone how to properly wear their Via Ferrata sets 🪢 and provide assistance during the climb if needed 🆘. My goal is to ensure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience while exploring the beauty of the mountain ⛰️👀. 🧗‍♀️👍
