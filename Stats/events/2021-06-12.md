Julien from the GAC.

## PS
If some one is motivated to organize it, it is possible to spend half a day in the circus bottom (i.e. no hike 😉) to enjoy the sun, a view of the falls and play outdoor games that you bring. In that case, both groups can join at the end of the day before hiting back to Grenoble!
