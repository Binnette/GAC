##  🥾🔴 Hike: ⛄❄ snow walk (and bath?😱🥶) in Chamrousse!? 🧊 

* 🔴 Not for noobs/beginners
* 🔺 Hiking shoes & winter/rain gears mandatory. Otherwise your feet will be wet and frozen (-10°C felt temperature on top)

How about a snowy walk in Chamrousse? 🏔️ You'll need hiking shoes with good crampons or you'll end up with wet and frozen feet 😱. And you might slide without them ⛸️. Hiking poles are also a good idea to avoid slipping on the snow ❄️. It will feel like -10°C 🧊 on top, with lots of clouds ☁️ and maybe some snowflakes 🌨. Don't forget to bring a thick plastic bag 🛍 to slide down the slopes 🛷. We probably won't need snowshoes as there is not much snow 🥾. For the bravest ones, you can even pack your swimsuit 🩳👙. We can try a cold/frozen dip in "Lacs Robert". 🏊‍♂️
