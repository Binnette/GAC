Then we go the Ferme des Maquis where we can see goats (their babies are now grown-up) and bought products done with their milk 🧀. Finally we hike down by the village of Saint-Martin d'Hères and go back to the bus station and parking 😎 You can go back home when we are at the village of Saint-Martin d'Hères if it is more convenient for you, but please let me know.
