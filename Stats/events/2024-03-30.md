##  🥾🟢 Hike: Montmayeur towers rainy rendez-vous 🏰🌧️ 

* 🟢 Should be OK for everyone. Maybe some mud because of the rain.

Who says the Grenoble Adventure Club (GAC) shies away from a little rain? 🌧️ Let's demonstrate our resilience and gracefully navigate through the raindrops. 💧 Our journey begins with a 45-minute drive 🚗, arriving at the quaint village of Villaroux in Savoie. 🏡 In the morning, we'll traverse the open fields adjacent to the forest 🌾🌲 and even drop by the charming village of Soucy. 🏘️ As we venture into the woods, we'll ascend to the twin towers of Montmayeur, remnants of an ancient castle. 🏰 Here, we might take shelter near or within the towers for our lunch break 🍞🧀, safeguarding us from the wind and rain. 🌬️🌧️ Our afternoon will be spent meandering through the forest and over the hills 🌳🌲, with the hope of catching a panoramic view of the valleys below. 👀🏞️ Completing our loop, we'll return to the parking lot where, if you've planned ahead, dry clothes, socks, and shoes await. 👕🧦👟 Finally, we'll head back to Grenoble by car. 🚗💨
