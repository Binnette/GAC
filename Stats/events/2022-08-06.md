##  🚣 About canoeing 🚣 
I've done this event 1 year ago. In my opinion, it is open to beginners. There is no "extreme" difficulty. You row your boat with 1 or 2 people. You can make team of "I want fun and go crazy underwater canoeing" or "I prefer to stay as dry as a bone". No need to have a lot of muscles, the river will push us gently to the end. Just don't miss the finish line on the left of Oxford bridge.

❗ You HAVE TO know how to swim (at least 25 meters with your head temporary under water: [https://canoe-grenoble.com/infos-pratiques/](https://canoe-grenoble.com/infos-pratiques/) (READ IT). Note you will wear life jacket and helmet provided by the company.

Note that we won't have any shadow during the whole afternoon. So take sun-cream/sunglasses/hat/water/etc. Wearing shoes and a long short will prevent you to get burned by the sun.

We will have tiny dry barrel so you can put a tiny bag with your phone and papers inside.
