We will have a quick look to the "fire fountain" then get back in the cars and park in the village of **Lanchâtre.** Then we will do a straight up hike to the top of the nearest mountain to enjoy the view on the valley while having lunch. And finally do a straight down hike to get back to cars and to Grenoble.
