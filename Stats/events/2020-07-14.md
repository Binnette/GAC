Please read everything below and be sure to understand all before registering for the wait so there is no confusion! :)

**********************************
Hey Gang!

We would like to plan something a little festive and relaxing to celebrate the French Revolution on Tuesday July 14th!

As our group is composed of outdoor enthusiast we would like to plan a hike and beach day :)

The hike will be of low difficulty level (as we will still be sore from Sunday!) so any and all skill levels can complete this, even babies!

The hike will include "Les passerelles himalayennes" - Leila mentioned these previously in conversation, so technically it's her idea :)

The views are wonderful and we will pass many beautiful sites and flowers - Siwar bring your plant identification application!

You can find more information about the July 14th “Freedom Hike” here:

If you have done this before and have info to share with the group don't hesitate in the comments section.

While a train option from Grenoble is possible it will include a little bit of additional walking from the train station at Monestier-de-Clermont to arrive to our destination - which is no problem for the Grenoble Hiking Club!

But we are also seeking out volunteer drivers who may also be interested in ride sharing. The drive is about 1 hour from Grenoble city center or 58KM.

As an incentive to drivers and to cover all fuel cost’s we will set the round trip (aller retour) cost per passenger at 10 euro (14,20 euro for the train - so passengers save and drivers gain).

So if you are a driver and have three available seats that’s 30 euro to you, if you have four available seats that’s 40 euro, etc…

This event will cost everyone 6 euro for a required boat ride as part of the circuit, cost of food (pack what you want or eat at a café), and the cost of being a passenger in a vehicle (or profit if you are a driver!)

The hike + boat ride will take 4.5 hours, plus lets plan on spending a few more hours (another 4.5 hours) either doing additional hiking, swimming, socializing or eating and enjoying the views - I will be doing a little bit of everything, mais tu fais ce que tu veux :)

Ideally we should plan to leave Grenoble around 8:30am and depart back to Grenoble around 5:30pm - once back in Grenoble we can plan something else to wrap the evening up.

We will provide more details soon, but it will be a good time guaranteed so don't worry about that! Just save the date!

Please do not RSVP to this event yet!

We need to first plan the logistics and then we will send out an updated planning schedule tomorrow night - before we get too tired from Julien's hike on Sunday ;) - so be ready to RSVP Tomorrow !!

The objective for the moment is to know how to organize the transportation between train and car, so if you are an available driver and this event sounds interesting to you, send me a message! Like that we can plan better :)

Hopefully we will have enough drivers so we can stay together and not be seperated by train and car :)

So if you are interested in this event and ride sharing please send a message to me via Meetup or SMS @ 07 87 86 12 95 as soon as possible with the number of available seats. N'oublie pas 10 euro per available seat!

Additionally, if someone has some information or ideas for fireworks in the evening please feel free to share. The only thing I can find is an hour from Grenoble city center and also an hour from where we will be at for the hiking and swiming. So if you know of something that is convenient please let us know!

** and in the spirit of democracy, freedom, and liberty, be prepared to vote on a new name for the club on Tuesday!!

VIVE LA FRANCE, VIVE LA LIBERTÉ, VIVE LA RÉPUBLIQUE !!!
