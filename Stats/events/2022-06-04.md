##  ⭐⭐ Updates ⭐⭐ 
* 📅 June 4 - 6am: police took my car. I just called them and I can only grab it at 9:30 😭 You have enough cars to do the hike. I will join you in the afternoon at the lake. Sorry about that. If you want to do the hike, use the GPX track and the instructions on GAC website.
* 📅 June 3 - 12am: more cars = more seats. Seats: Albin (0), Ayman (4), Daniel (5), Thomas (5), Monsef&Zineb (5), Anastasia (4)

##  🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️ 
🦅/🐓 : we speak English/French in all our events. Don't worry if your English/French is not that good. Nos évènements sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas "suffisant".
