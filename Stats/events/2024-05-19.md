* 🔵 Maybe mud because of rain. Not so long.

Is it going to be a rainy weekend? 🌧️ Nope! 🚫 It looks like we’ve got a chance to dodge Sunday’s showers! 🌤️ Let’s hop in the car 🚗 and head west from Grenoble to the quaint village of Morette, home to about 400 souls. 🏡 We’ll park right in front of the **mairie** and kick off our escapade there. 🗺️ We’ll bid farewell to the village and soon begin our trek through the woods. 🌲🥾 Next, we’ll stroll through the hamlet of “l’Eslinard,” stirring up memories from our not-so-distant past visit. 🍃👣 Continuing our climb amidst the trees, we’ll eventually descend to “Col de Châtain.” 🍂 There’s a picnic spot with a cover, making it the ideal setting for our lunch break with a view. 🥪🌄 Afterward, it’s back into the forest for a little more uphill action before completing our circuit and descending back to the village. 🔄🏞️
