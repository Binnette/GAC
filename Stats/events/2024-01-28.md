##  🥾🟢 Hike: Sainte-Agnès, a village between forest 🌲 and mountains ⛰️ 

* 🟢 Ok for regular hikers with mud ready shoes
* 🔵 Maybe a bit steep for noobs

🚗 We will park our cars in the village of Saint-Agnès, near the church and the townhall. 🏘️ 🥾 We will start our hike from here on a nice path until we get to a hill and hopefully have a view of the Grésivaudan valley. 🌄 🌲 Then we will enter the forest and do a loop around the village. 🌳 🏡 After that, we will leave the forest and go through the village and come back to our starting point. 🚗
