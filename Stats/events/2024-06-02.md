##  🥾🔴 Hike: forest 🌲 hike near "La Rivière" village and hut exploration 🏡 

* 🔴 Ok for good hikers, but steep and maybe wet
* ⚫ Hard for noobs: very steep, quite long and slippery

This weekend, it seems the clouds 🌥️ will be gathering once again. We’re planning to avoid them by heading to the west side of Vercors. We’ll drive 🚗 from Grenoble and park at the town hall in La Rivière, a village with 729 residents. 🏘️
Our hike 🥾 starts in the village, moving through the fields 🌾 and crossing the river “Le Versoud”, known for canyoning 🧗‍♂️💧. We’ll then enter the forest 🌲 and begin our ascent to the hamlet “Les Monts”. A brief detour will offer us a view from a field 🌄 before we return to the forest and continue to “Le Cuchet” hill and the nearby hut 🏡.
Afterward, we’ll head down ⬇️, passing a picnic area 🧺 and a second hut “Cabane de la Fessie”. Our descent concludes back in the village, where we might visit the local church ⛪ before returning to our cars. 🚗 With some luck, we’ll avoid the rain. 🌦️🤞
