🌞🌡️Tired of the scorching 35°C 🥵🌡️ in Grenoble? Let’s escape to the mountains 🏔️ and enjoy some fresh air and water 💦 ! We will 🚗 for 1 hour and park near Lavaldens, a village in the Matheysine region. Then we will hike through the shady forest 🌲 and pass by a refuge and an alpine hut 🏠. At the alpine hut, we will start a loop trail that will take us to the Rif Bruyant lake 🌊 If it’s not dry, we can swim in it and cool off 🏊‍♂️ Then we will finish the loop and return to the car. We will 🚗 to Lac de Petichet, another gorgeous lake where we can relax, swim and have fun (bring some games) 😎 We can even buy pizzas and drinks at the lake 🍕🥤
I plan to 🌙 stay there as long as possible to avoid the heat wave in Grenoble. Who’s with me? 😁
