# Night Hike/Rando: Bastile my Moonlight (To celebrate change in Curfew)

![2021-06-18](/Stats/img/orig/2021-06-18.jpg)

An urban night hike above the city celebrate the relaxation of curfew to 23H and also pay tribute to those who have suffered or lost someone during the pandemic (**)!

√∞¬ü¬í¬° Note: if you want to sleep in the mountain near Mont Rachais, Albin is organizing an "alternative" end for this hike √∞¬ü¬å¬ô You can subscribe here: https://mensuel.framapad.org/p/sleepingnearrachais-9o0x

Sunset on next Friday is at 20:45; but it should be well dark on the western trail to Bastille before then.

THE PATH IS SET!

There are 3 well known paths from Grenoble to the Bastille.

There are also two-to-three less-well-known ones, and that's the one for us!
