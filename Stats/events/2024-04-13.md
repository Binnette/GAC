##  🧗🔴 Via ferrata: 'Jules Carret' 🥵 + 🚿 in refreshing waterfall? 🧊 

* 🔵 medium for climbers
* 🔴 hard for noobs 🙃 + a lot of vertigo

Is it too early for a via ferrata? **Certainly not!** 🧗‍♂️ Especially with the promise of a sunny weekend in Grenoble, where temperatures will hover around a pleasant **25°C**. ☀️
🚗 **Our Journey Begins**: We’ll hop into our car and head toward the charming village of Lovettaz, near Chambéry. 🏘️ From there, our adventure unfolds:
🌲 **Forest Hike**: Amidst towering trees, we’ll venture into the lush forest. Our destination? The starting point of our via ferrata.
🧗‍♂️ **ED (Extremely Difficult) Via Ferrata**: Not for the faint-hearted! We’ll ascend rugged cliffs, clinging to iron rungs and cables. Not for Noobs!
🏔️ **Summit Views**: At the pinnacle, we’ll pause for a detour. Behold the “Croix du Nivolat,” where the landscape unfolds beneath us. 🌅
🎿 **Steep Descent**: The narrow path known as “Pas de l’Echelle” awaits. Our legs will feel the burn as we make our way back to Lovettaz and our parking spot. 🏞️
💦 **Chasing Waterfalls**: If time permits, we’ll seek out the enchanting “Cascade de la Doria.” Prepare for a refreshing—and perhaps slightly chilly—🥶 shower! 🚿
