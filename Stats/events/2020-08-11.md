## 🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️
🦅/🐓 : we speak English/French in all our events. Don't be worry if your english is not that good. Nos events sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas "suffisant".

## 🧗‍♀️ Via ferrata 'Les prises de la Bastille' 🧗‍♂️
We will do "Les prises de la Bastille", the 1st part for sure (the 2nd part is an option).
The 1st part is rated as rather difficult to difficult and lasts for 1h. The 2nd part is rated difficult to very difficult and is more technical and physical. It also last 1h. You can escape between both part if you are tired or don't want to continue.

## ⚠️ Rent or bring your equipment! ⚠️
If you don't have it already, you'll need to rent your Via Ferrata equipment (casque+baudrier+longes).

For example, you can go to the shop "Adrénaline Sport" near the cinema Pathé Chavant, "Takamaka" on the quai near "Jardin de Ville" or "La Randonnée" near the tram stop "Gustave Rivet". You should try the equipment into the shop to see if it suit you well. It costs between 10 to 15€ for 1 day.

This event is free except for the renting of the equipment.

## ❔ What do you need ❔
- Via Ferrata equipment : casque+baudrier+longes
- A good pair of shoes (hiking shoes are highly recommended otherwise you may slip on the rocks)
- Some water
- Some snack only if you want
- Headlamp (in case we are really too slow)

## 🤓 Initiation to Via Ferrata 🤓

I (Albin) am not a guide and i will not be responsible of you or your security. But I will teach you how to do Via Ferrata safely. I'm also used to do Via Ferrata with totally beginners, so I will ensure that you can complete the Via Ferrata safely.

For safety reason, I will limit the group to a maximum of 5 people including me.

## 🍔 After 🍔

If you feel like it, we can have a drink/some food after the climbing.

If you have any questions, please ask!

See you tonigth. Albin from GAC.
