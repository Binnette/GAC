##  🥾🔵 Hike: Castle of Bon Repos 🏰 #Chestnut 🌰 #Tram 🚊 

* 🔵 No difficulty but can be a long hike for noobs.

We’ll meet at the Echirolles tramway station Denis Papin and walk on a flat path to leave the city behind. It will be a nice warm-up for us 😊. Then we’ll follow a trail and enter the forest 🌲. We’ll go up and reach the town of Jarrie. There we’ll see the castle “Château de bon repos” 🏰. We can take a break there and have our lunch 🍽️.

After that, we’ll continue our hike and climb a little more. We’ll try to find some chestnuts 🌰 along the way. I hope there are some left, and that they are not too small or eaten by worms 😬. We’ll enjoy a "beautiful" view over Champ-sur-Drac 🌄.

Then we’ll cross the village of Champagnier. We’ll go through another forest and look for more chestnuts 🌰. Finally, we’ll get back to the tram stop and say goodbye 👋. That will be the end of our adventure 😍.
