We hike to Lac Charlet (swim if we can). Go top of Le Tabor 2389m and enjoy the view. Go down to Le Piquet de Nantes (2214m). Then Go back to cars by another way. After we can try to do "Urbex" (Urban eXploration) of the old ski station. Then eventually we can go to Lac de Petichet and swim there. Finally go back to Grenoble Bermude City.
