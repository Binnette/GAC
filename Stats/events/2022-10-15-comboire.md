##  Summary 

An nice easy hike enjoy the weekend. We'll be starting late in the day to let the garish sun start setting in the west behind the Vercors.

The Second in a series of "Easy Hikes Around Town Without Cars" GAC Events that I'll be hosting this summer (Trains, Trams, Bus, Telepherique only!)

🚋 Starting from a tram station (Line C).
👁️‍🗨️ Note that the "fort" is normally/probably closed to public, so we will hike 'around' it.

There is a beautiful place from which to enjoy the Sunset.

##  🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️ 
🦅/🐓 : We speak English/French in all our events. Don't be worry if your English/French is not that good. Nos évènements sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas "suffisant".
