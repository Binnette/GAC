# Weekend Hike: Sassenage Area, Chemin des Cuves, Suivez Le Furon, Mur de Satan

![2021-01-10](/Stats/img/orig/2021-01-10.jpg)

## Plan

- Meet at Parc Karl Marx between 10h and 10:30h
- Logistics: Take A-Tram to Louis Maisonnat or C-Tram to Seyssinet Pariset, then walk to Karl Marx
- Route: I've put together a hodge-podge route through the Vercors foothills around Village Sassenage/Fountain which should make for some interesting cartography in real-time!
( Subject to modification depending on trail conditions. )
- Ultimate Goal to find rock climbing area "Mur de Satan"
- Difficulty: Easy-to-Moderate
- Distance: 6.4 miles / 10.3 km
- Duration: Not so long, just enough to break a sweat and stretch the lungs and legs.
