# Run/Hike to Batille: sunset and (almost) full moon🏃‍♀️🥾🌕

![2022-02-18-run](../img/orig/2022-02-18-run.jpg)

We will be two groups starting together and ascending either by hiking or trail running; I will be with the runners. We will meet again at the top to enjoy the view (so far, the weather is forecasted to be nice, let's keep our fingers crossed for a clear view) 😊

Obviously, the runners will reach the top sooner, I would like to do some stretching and practice shadow boxing meanwhile. I would be happy to teach some basics of boxing if anyone is interested 😉
Then we will descend either by hiking or running.

Both groups will take the classic route starting from Fontaine du Lion and ending near Musée archéologique Saint-Laurent.
