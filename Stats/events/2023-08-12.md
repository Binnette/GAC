##  🥾🟢 Plan 

A continuation in a series of "Easy Hikes Around Town Without Cars" GAC Events I'll be hosting this summer. In two (2) parts:

We will meet at the rally point and walk to the village of Sassenage.

1. We will visit the underground Caves/Cuves du Sassenage for a guided tour. The cost is [Adult: 8 € ; Student : 7 € ; Enfant : 5 €] and it takes about 30 minutes.

NOTE: The temperature underground is 10 - 15degC, so one must bring a jacket or hoodie, even if it is 35degC on the surface.

2. After the tour is over, we will take a walk and follow the beautiful trail that shadows "Le Furon", named for it's stunning beauty and potential ferocity, a series of cascades that descend from the heart of the Vercor Mountains down into the village of Sassenage (just north-west of Grenoble).

Near the cascades, temperatures are normally 5degC cooler than in the city center, so this is an exceptionally good place/location to visit during the "dog days of summer" in Grenoble to beat the heat.

##  Walking Route Details 

The walk/hike part of the event event is 5 miles / 8km distance over mixed terrain (Roads, Trails, Cascades/Boulders) - Out and Back
