Joining the event = Accepting the rules (See rule section below)

👀 Note I will probably limit the group to 10 or 12. I can not deal with a bigger group. Also I am not a ski teacher, but I will try to help you.

##  ⭐⭐ Updates ⭐⭐ 
> 📅 Jan 14 - 3pm: Pauline, Anubhav. One of our drivers may have to cancel. So sorry about I had to cancel your reservation for now. Adam let us know if you can join.
> 📅 Jan 14 - 3pm: more cars = more seats. Seats: Albin (4), Jochem (4), Adam??? (4)

##  🗨️ EN/FR 🗨️ 
🦅/🐓 : we speak English/French in all our events. Don't worry if your English/French is not that good. Nos évènements sont en Anglais et Français. Ne soyez pas inquiets si votre niveau d'anglais n'est pas "suffisant".

##  🎿 Ski: Ski for NOOB ONLY. Beginner training ⛷ 
Ski training for noob/beginner ONLY. We will stay together during the whole day.

🟨 If you are a good skier, you can join but you will stay with the group and help them to learn how to ski.

🟨 DO NOT BRING YOUR SKI (unless you have your own car) cause there is no place in my car. We will rent ski directly at the station.

Meet at 8am at parking "Esplanade du Souvenir Français" near Parc Paul Mistral:

We ride our cars for about 45m. Then park our car(s) directly at the ski station :

##  🎿 Ski renting🎿 
We will go to the shop "AB Sport" to rent ski directly at ski station. It will take time if we are a big group so be patient. The shop is open 9am-12:30pm and 1pm-5pm. So we will stop ski near 4:30pm to bring the ski to the shop.

Renting Ski + Ski shoes + pole + helmet = 20€50 (Detail here: https://s.42l.fr/-7o3JT-y)

##  💲 Ski Pass 💲 
To enter the ski station, you need a ski pass. Two options:
- 13€80 Only the beginner part of the station
- 21€ Full station
