# Return à Vizille (via Vélo) - Museum of the French Revolution + Picnic / Hike

![2022-05-15-bike](/Stats/img/orig/2022-05-15-bike.jpg)

Ask yourself: How does a bougie chateau in the south of France act as a symbol for the French Revolution, which resulted in removing [the heads of] the aristocracy?

Come find out for yourself! We will return to Vizille! Pack a lunch picnic and pump of your Vélo tyres! On-y-va!

Vizille is an exhibit, free to all, and is run by the Govt.. It is composed of the outdoor garden spaces (which includes an outdoor zoo of sorts), as well as the Museum housed within a Chateau/Castle.

The chateau played a pivotal role in the history of the aftermath of the French revolution; this pivotal time in French history is the subject of the museum; come and learn about it!

## =Main Route=

The Vélo route from Grenoble to Vizille is a VERY EASY route. Less than 2 hours of riding, approximately 20.5 km distance, and at max a 1-2% incline grade.

You can preview it here: https://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/4951451242/

Trail path for (optional) hike that day: https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/france/isere/belvedere-de-vizille

Only 990 feet (333 meter) elevation increase/change. So we will barely break a sweat. But it should be a nice way to end the day.

## =Alternative Transportation=
Alternatively, if you wish to join via Car or Bus (route Transisère X03)

Our ETA window for arrival at Village Vizille center via Velo is estimated to be 10:15->10:30 AM. We can coalesce at the entrance to the museum.
