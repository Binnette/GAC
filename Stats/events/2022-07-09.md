##  Summary 

A fourth (4th) in a series of Hikes around Grenoble without Cars and a Hybrid/Crossover Event between my Museum Meetup and the GAC

We will visit an incredible Museum dedicated to the History and current status of Hydro electric renewable energy, of which Grenoble France is the birthplace!

##  🟢 🥾 Difficulty / Skill 🟢 🥾

The hiking parts This event will classify this as an "easy" hike, as the event is NOT TECHNICALLY CHALLENGING. But there will be a considerable distance traveled on foot (\~ 15km over 12 hours).

Reading French is the difficulty part.

##  General Plan (Detailed Plan Below Under Development) 

We will take the Regional/TransIsère bus [T75] from [Grenoble Gare] to Region [Le Bourg-d'Oisans] bus stop [Rochetaillee] on the outskirts of village [Allemont]

We'll hike to the EDF Museum on an easy (flat) 7+ km, passing through village [Allemont] and passing over the Dam on the beautiful [ Eau D'Olle / Lac Du Verney]

We'll visit the museum, which is free, and rather impressive ( but not incredibly large).

After a small snack, we'll go up village Vaujany (hopefully on a Bus/Shuttle, if we can, otherwise by foot if we have to 5km) which is at 800m.

At Vaujany, we'll board the Téléphérique and ride it to Ski Station [L'Alpette] at 2100m which crosses a Canyon passes by a Waterfall/Cascade.

From there, we'll make a 6-7km hike (out and back) around the iconic area of [Lac Besson] where there are 4x beautiful mountain lakes of which we'll have our pick for a picnic spot.

Then we'll take another different set of Téléphérique back down to village [Allemont] stopping/transitioning cars in village [ Oz-en-Oisans ].

Arriving at village [Allemont], we'll hike back to bus stop.
