# Friday Night Improvisation & Late Planning

![2020-07-10](/Stats/img/orig/2020-07-10.jpg)

We will meet at Place Grenette by the fountain at 7pm - then we will find a place to eat - no hiking skills required, just bring your mouth :)

We will plan on 10-15 euro plates/meals. If you are not hungry you can still join us for a drink and help us to plan all the many activities we have in the next coming days :)
