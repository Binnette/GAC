## 🌠🌠 Updates 🌠🌠
> 📅 August 12 - 7pm: we won't go to Mont Jalla because of the lightnings and Mont Jalla is the perfect place to be "zapped". But instead we can still go to Bastille if you want to (but we won't sleep in the mountain tonight)
> 📅 August 12 - 6pm: I hope you have laser eyes to see the stars behind the clouds 😂🤣🤣🤣
> 📅 August 12 - 2pm: I just called the cable car company. And the big gate (top of Bastille) is closed from 12pm (midnight) to 6am.
> 📅 August 12 - 1pm: the weather will be cloudy ☁️ / rainy 🌧️ with some thunderbolts ⚡️... Don't forget to bring your raincoat 🌧️⛈️☔️⚡️🌩️ We maybe won't be able to sleep out in the open... then we will probably go back to Grenoble.
> 📅 August 9 - 6pm: 🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠

## 🌠⛺ Night of the shooting stars! Let's go to Jalla (and why not sleep there) 🌠
Let's go to Mont Jalla to see some shooting stars 🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠

You can either sleep up-there or go back to Grenoble with the rest of the group. (I will sleep up there) 😊🌠

If you sleep up there, the sun will wake us near 6:30am. So we will have time to go back to Grenoble and go to... work if you are not on holidays (I'm not...)

💥⛔ If you don't sleep at Mont Jalla, you MUST be back at top of Bastille (cable car station) BEFORE 12pm (midnight) because the big gate on top is closed between 12pm to 6am. If you are late and this big gate is closed you can go back in Grenoble by the main car road (https://s.42l.fr/FsQLrrr0) but it will be longer. Once you passed the big gate at top of Bastille, there is no other closed gate if you follow the same track that we used to go up (https://s.42l.fr/VciaZ431). Note that if you want to take tramway, ensure that you won't miss the last tram.
