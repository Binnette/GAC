Hi everyone, bring your swimsuit & hiking shoes! We will meet at the end of line A tramway station "La Poya" at 14:00. Then we will walk to "Cuves de Sassenages" and enjoy some "refreshing" swimming there. If people are interested we can also visit the "Cuves de Sassenage" for 8€ per person (no equipment needed, just good shoes to walk into the cave).

Next we will climb up to Vercors and pass through "Ferme Durand". And finally get back to the tram station "La Poya". As always after the hiking we can go to a pub and have some food together.

What do you need
---------------
- Hiking shoes (or good shoes) and some snack for the hike
- Swimsuit+Towel if you plan to swim
- 8€ money if you plan to visit the cave
