* 🔴 Hard for beginners
* 🔵 Medium for good hikers

We start our hike by parking our 🚗 at the lake, where we can leave our games and swimsuits for later 👣 We follow the trail that leads us to the village of Corps, where we can admire the old houses and the church. 🌲 We continue our hike through the forest, enjoying the shade and the fresh air. 🌳 We reach the neighborhood of St-Julien, where we can see the impressive rock formations and the views of the valley. 🏔 We climb up to the peak of Peyrague, where we can enjoy the panoramic view of the lake and the mountains. 😍 We start our descent, and make a loop back to Corps and then to the lake. 💦💧🏊‍♂️ We put on our swimsuits and jump into the lake... if you are not disturbed by the fact of swimming while it is raining 🌧 Also you can have some drinks at a nearby cafe ☕
