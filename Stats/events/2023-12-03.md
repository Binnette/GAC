##  🥾🔵 Hike: Snow Walk Peyrouse from St-Jean-de-Vaulx ⛄❄ 

* 🔵/🔴 A bit steep for beginners. Don't forget snow ready shoes
* 🟢 Easy for good hikers.

🌧️🌨️ After a wet and cold Saturday, let’s enjoy a nice snow walk hike on Sunday. I have chosen a lower mountain to avoid any danger of avalanches and snow on the road. We will drive our cars for 40 minutes and park at the village of Saint-Jean-de-Vaulx. 🚗🚙 From there, we will begin our climb and pass by a small hamlet called les Arnauds. 🏘️ We will keep hiking until we reach the mountain named Beauregard (which means good looking eyes in English). 👀 We will go down and up again until la Peyrouse, which is the highest point of our journey (1710m). 🏔️ We will have our lunch break there and admire the view. 🍽️👌 Then we will start sliding down and walking down until another small hamlet named le Villaret. 🛷🚶‍♂️ From there, we will follow a path along the road to get back to our cars. 🛣️ I hope to see you for this adventure! 🙌
